            <blockquote>
  <p>INTJs apply (often ruthlessly) the criterion “Does it work?” to everything
from their own research efforts to the prevailing social norms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I first took the Myers-Briggs personality test in the Navy, stationed at the
Defense Threat Reduction Agency in New Mexico. I believe it was some sort of
HR project for the civilians on base that I worked with, and I was asked to
participate as well. I was pleased with the results, and perhaps even a bit
proud of the favorable description. Reading the results I found several
instances where the profile matched or explained past behavior, but truthfully
I wondered if I had unconsciously steered the test in the way that I wanted it
to go. Several months later, I took the test again, and again got the same
results: <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/INTJ">INTJ</a>.
Satisfied after taking the test as honestly as possible, I moved on.</p>

<p>Personality tests attempt to generalize patterns of behavior. Since all people
are unique in their experiences, not everything these tests say will be
accurate. Any attempt to explain behavior should be taken with a very large
grain of salt. Uniqueness is not something we humans like to have in our world
though, so we love to group, categorize, and label people. It is a behavior we
learned in middle school, and extends well into our adult life. Some people
cannot understand others without some sort of grouping context to place them
in, even if the context is grossly inaccurate. Personality tests can be a way
to avoid this conscious or unconscious categorization for managers who want to
understand and effectively communicate with their employees. For individuals
though, and, particularly for me, the tests can provide insight into <em>why I do
the things I do</em>.</p>

<p>The other day Benjamin Brooks, from the excellent <a href="http://brooksreview.net/">Brooks
Review</a>, tweeted the results from a personality test
he had taken. Brooks, like myself, is an
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/BenjaminBrooks/status/55050601888890880">INTJ</a>. The
tweet made me wonder if my personality had changed over the years, and if I
took the test again if I would get the same result. So, I did and so… I am. My
results did not change. The test still classifies me as an INTJ. The test
results were not nearly as important to me as reading portions of the profile
to my wife. The profile embarrassed me by how well fit portions of my life,
particularly in my relationships with friends and family.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The emotions of an INTJ are hard to read, and neither male nor female INTJs
are apt to express emotional reactions. At times, INTJs seem cold, reserved,
and unresponsive, while in fact they are almost hypersensitive to signals of
rejection from those they care for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was a child, I was part of the “Gifted and Talented” project. As part
of the project, I saw a counselor, who did several tests. The counselor
predicted that I would have few friends, but the friends I had would be very
close. The prediction has been very accurate so far. I generally like people,
and try very hard to be polite, but if the person is not deemed by my brain as
being important or relevant somehow, I forget them almost immediately after
meeting. I do not do it to be a jerk; it is just how my mind works. On the
other hand, I still know where my best friend from high school is, and if he
showed up at my doorstep tonight, we would spend the rest of the night getting
caught up.</p>

<p>Having the type of brain that I have makes me very good at some things, like
being a systems administrator. I build and organize large, complex,
intricately interwoven patterns of things. I have the ability to understand
complex technological concepts, and am very good at explaining those concepts
to others. I am very good at teaching, mentoring, and talking with others one
on one. I know what I am good at, but more importantly, I know what I am <em>not</em>
good at. I am not good at informal group meetings or luncheons. I am not good
at the after work meet up at the local bar. I am not good at small talk about
sports or hunting. When considering my interactions with others, it is not
enough to just say, “I’m not good with people”, that is inaccurate. I am very
good with people, I am not good with informal social groups of people, because
I do not understand the dynamics of how they work, or how I am expected to
behave. I much prefer a small, quiet coffee.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>INTJs are analytical. Like INTPs, they are most comfortable working alone
and tend to be less sociable than other types. Nevertheless, INTJs are
prepared to lead if no one else seems up to the task, or if they see a major
weakness in the current leadership. They tend to be pragmatic, logical, and
creative. They have a low tolerance for spin or rampant emotionalism. They are
not generally susceptible to catchphrases and do not recognize authority based
on tradition, rank, or title.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That last sentence might seem out of place for me, considering my military
background. My friends from the Navy would know that it hits the nail on the
head. There was more than one Chief I went toe to toe with, and since I was
outranked, I usually lost. I was in the Navy, and I loved the travel and
opportunities it gave me, but I never quite <em>fit</em> in the Navy. Some fit in the
Navy like an old glove; I was more like forcing a round peg in a square hole.
I needed the Navy in my life, and I am proud to have served for the eleven
years that I did, but I was also glad to leave.</p>

<p>It is good to know that even though I have changed over the years, the core of
my personality has not. I still care deeply for my loved ones. I still keep my
space neat, clean, and organized. (As a side note, my parents never had to
tell me to clean my room. I kept it the way I liked it.) What I have learned
in the past few years is how to push myself outside of what I am good at, and
into things that make me uncomfortable or are simply not my strong point. Like
working on home improvement and music, and even saying yes, every now and
again, when asked to go to lunch.</p>

<p>Personality tests are not gospel; they are not the be all and end all of who
you are. However, if you are like me, by taking a test you might be able to
gain some insight into why you do what you do. The test might help you find
your strengths, and identify some weaknesses.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps the most fundamental problem, however, is that INTJs really want
people to make sense.</p>
