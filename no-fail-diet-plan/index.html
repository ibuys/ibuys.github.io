            <p>Seriously, does anyone really need to know <em>how</em> to loose weight these days?  No matter what super plan you choose, it always comes down to <strong>eat less an exercise more</strong>. There is no secret formula, and there is no magic pill that will help you achieve the body that you want.</p>

<p>Here’s another truth that no one wants to hear: your weight is your fault. You cannot blame genetics, how you were taught to eat, your job, your wife, your husband, your kids, your dog, the government, or any other outside influence other than yourself. It is true that some people are more prone to weight gain than others, but that does not mean that you can’t do anything about it.  Blaming anything except your own habits is a cop-out. To start the 100% guaranteed program, you have to face reality, and you have to take responsibility for your own actions.</p>

<p>So, here’s my super simple, 100% guaranteed, no way you can <em>not</em> lose weight, weight loss plan.</p>

<p>Step one, watch what you eat. That means no McDonalds, Burger King, Hardie’s, or Sonic. Eating fast food makes you fat. I like a <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/app_controller.nutrition.index1.html">double-quarter pounder</a> with fries as much as the next guy, but seriously, you never need that many calories in one setting. I’d say that’s like a once every six months meal, not once a week (or day). If you have to eat out, go to Subway and order a six-inch <a href="http://world.subway.com/Countries/NutritionFiles/AUS%209.2005.pdf">veggie delight</a> on whole wheat. Seriously, try it, they are really good!</p>

<p>Next, stop right now and go look in your refrigerator and your pantry. OK, how much pre-prepared food did you see? Boxed, one-pan, no cooking skills necessary stuff, you know what I mean. If you are eating ingredients that you cannot pronounce, there is a problem. For example, I cannot think of the last time a recipe called for <a href="http://chemindustry.com/chemicals/467010.html">L-Cystein Hydrochloride</a>. Use raw ingredients as much as possible. Even if the resulting recipe is high in fat and calories, at least you know what’s in it. That leads me to my next point.</p>

<p>Fill up half your plate with veggies. Make a salad that only contains vegetables. Lettuce, carrots, cabbage, broccoli, olives, onions, etc… Fill up a quarter of your plate with a slice of bread or something similar. This is your side dish. That doesn’t mean that it gets its own plate, its there to take up room on your plate, and therefor in your stomach. Now you should have only a quarter of your plate left to fill, that’s for the main course. Also, get a pint glass of ice cold water to go with your meal. Drink the water before drinking anything else.</p>

<p>Speaking of drinking, here’s another hard lesson to learn. Alcohol makes you fat. Alcohol add nothing of value to your diet. As in all things, moderation is OK, but drinking a six pack a night is a sure path to failure. Also, drinking a bottle of wine in one sitting is also very bad for your health.  Remember the glass of water at dinner time? Drink that first, and you won’t be as tempted to drink so much beer or wine or whatever you like with your meal.</p>

<p>So, that covers eating and drinking, now for the fun part: exercise! If the sun is shining, turn off the TV, shutdown the computer, and go outside. It’s actually very difficult <em>not</em> to exercise when you are outside, because there is always something to do. At the very least, take a walk. Do some gardening, shovel snow, make a snowman, go out and <strong>do something</strong>. You can pick up a sport. I’m learning how to swim laps in a pool. It’s not as easy as it sounds, but learning something new is enthralling. I get bored weight lifting and running on the treadmill, but you may really enjoy it.</p>

<p>There are literally thousands of sports, and if you keep looking, you are bound to find one that’s just challenging enough without being too overbearing. However, you must be brave, because here is the final hard lesson to learn. When you try something new, you are going to look like a fool. This is universal, and unavoidable. No matter what it is, no one is good at something the first time they try it. No matter what your chosen exercise is, until you get <em>good</em> at it, you are going to look silly. Be brave, this will pass. Here’s the great thing, the more you do it, the better you get at it, and the less ridiculous you will look doing it. Right now I rather resemble an obese housecat thrown into the pool while I’m learning how to swim. That’s OK, it will pass, the more I swim, the better I get at it.</p>

<p>Nothing worth doing is easy.</p>

<p>Focusing on technique, and actually getting better at something, while watching what you eat, naturally leads to the goal: <em>better health</em>. Better health means you can climb those stairs without getting winded, it means you can go ahead and sign up for the corporate softball league, it means you can keep up with your son when he wants to play football with you in the back yard, and you can keep up with your daughter when she wants to play basketball in the driveway. Better health naturally means a smaller waistline, and less extra pounds to carry around.</p>

<p>Eat less, eat <em>better</em>, and exercise. 100% no fail, guaranteed to work, every time. Period. Now, as for me, I’m going out back to try out my new set of cross-country skis, and play in the snow with my kids. I’ll be back online, but not until after a good workout.</p>
