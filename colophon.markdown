I like to write about technology, design, and culture. What is being connected all the time doing to us? How can we use new technology for good, how can we make the world a better place? 

I am, first and foremost, a Christian, and I believe Jesus meant the command he gave us in [Matthew 5:44][1]:

> But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;

I strive to live my life by the teachings of Paul in [1 Thessalonians 4:9-12][2]:

> 9 Now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other. 10 And in fact, you do love all of God’s family throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more, 11 and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you, 12 so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.

I’m also a husband and father of four, and balance a full time job at [TargetSmart](http://targetsmart.com/staff/jonathan-buys/). Keeping busy keeps me interested in personal productivity, and understanding computers and HCI keeps me on the lookout for how and why technology fails us, and how it can be improved.  

All writing on this site is done using Markdown in [MacVim][3] on a 2017 iMac 5k. The site is generated by [Jekyll][4], and hosted by [Github Pages][5]. The site design is my own, warts and all. I name all my computers after [first generation transformers][6], and my main machine is always Prime. 

I'm slowly reading through a list of [100 books][7]. 

I love meeting new people, and especially love good conversation. If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on Twitter as [@ibuys][8]. If you are ever around the Midwest, drop me a line and I'll show you the best coffee shop in town.
