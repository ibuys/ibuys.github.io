> Enable three-finger drag. Without this, dragging is fatiguing and probably a cause of repetitive strain injury. With it, dragging is effortless. (They really buried this one in macOS Mojave. It’s under System Preferences > Accessibility > Mouse & Trackpad > Trackpad Options… > Enable dragging > three finger drag.)

This is such a great trackpad tip. I just turned it on and I imagine it'll stay on. Soon as I tried the gesture it became clear that this is the natural way to drag and drop with a trackpad.
