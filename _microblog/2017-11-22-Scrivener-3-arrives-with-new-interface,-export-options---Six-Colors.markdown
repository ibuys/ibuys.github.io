> Obviously, Scrivener doesn’t turn you into a writer anymore than handing you a paintbrush turns you into Picasso, but if you’re looking for a tool to help you on your journey, it’s a great choice.

I used [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com) when writing my NaNoWriMo novel, but Scrivner was a close second choice. I'm not sure if it's quite for me, but it's an intriguing app.
