>I’ve been working the last few months on an update to the OmniFocus Video Field Guide. I’ve updated it for several new features and gone deep on the iOS Automation and URL linking. I'm making final edits and additions over the next few days and intend to publish it sometime Sunday (probably late).

OmniFocus is where my stress goes to die. It's where I regain control of my life. My system for making sure that things that need done aren't forgotten. Bills are paid, calls are made, and projects move forward. It's also where ideas go for evaluation. If I have an idea for a new project I'll drop it in OmniFocus and let it sit there for a while. I might file it away in it's own project folder, put a "Defer Until" date on it for the weekend, and let the idea sit and stew for a bit. 

If the idea has merit, if I keep coming back to it and deferring it more than once or twice, then I focus more on it and start to eck out next actions to start making it a reality. I know there are a lot of task management apps out there, and even a few analog systems like the Bullet Journal, but I'm so invested, and so used to how OmniFocus works that I have zero motivation to move to anything else. By this point, OmniFocus works the way my brain works, it is my trusted system. 

That's all thanks to David Spark's OmniFocus guides. I adopted his system years ago, modified it slightly and made it my own. I'm looking forward to seeing where he's taking the guides next.
