>"This is something which today people do not think is possible," said Musk. "To think the truck doesn't have enough power or it doesn't have enough range. With the Tesla Semi, we want to show that, no, an electric truck can out-torque any diesel semi, and if you had a tug-of-war competition, the Tesla semi will tug the diesel semi uphill."

I'm afraid the days of long-haul trucking as a career field might be numbered.
