MacVim, again. I've tried to make BBEdit work for me, but there's just so much that I wind up wishing for that I don't have BBEdit configured to do, or that there's just that *little* extra bit of friction. The last straw was when BBEdit decided it didn't need to soft-wrap the lines of Markdown files. I know that it's probably my fault somehow, but I'm just tired of making excuses for the app in my head.
