I"ë<p>Iâ€™ve loved reading some of the â€œPast Blastâ€ articles that have been
linked about in Twitter, so here is my contribution.</p>

<p><em>Two from Me</em></p>

<p><a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/on-graduation-day/">On Graduation Day</a>, written after I, finally, finished my bachelors
degree. A personal accomplishment that means a lot to me.</p>

<p><a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/the-master-craftsman/">The Master Craftsman</a>, solidifying the concept of my work as a craft,
whatever that work might be.</p>

<p><em>One from Daring Fireball</em></p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/10/the_life">The Life</a>, I just wrote about this article, but I think linking to
it today is in keeping with the spirit of the meem.</p>
