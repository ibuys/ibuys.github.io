I"ý<p>Itâ€™s been quiet here at home lately. Grey and overcast, rain morning, noon, and night. A good time to rest and recover from a lot of busy weeks. Iâ€™m essentially an introvert, and while I enjoy visiting it tends to take a lot out of me. Iâ€™ve always preferred long conversations over coffee to loud concerts or clubs. Iâ€™m on the couch this morning, my wifeâ€™s dog is next to me. The dog kept us up a lot last night. Itâ€™s nearly silent, but for the breath of the dog and the clack of the keys.</p>
