I":<p>Readability is a subscription based service that allows you to read the text off of websites in a beautiful, clean, consistent interface.  Since I started reading the web through Readability a while ago, I’ve appreciated it’s <em>consistency</em>, meaning that one site looks the same as the next, as the next, and the next. Reading articles on the web becomes more about the writing, and less about design. Jumping from site to site can be jarring, distracting, but when using Readability, the entire web can feel like a single book, one with many chapters.</p>
