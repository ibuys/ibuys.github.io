I"Œ<p>Iâ€™m a geek. Understanding that little fact puts me a little closer to being in touch with myself, and understanding that Iâ€™ve got a habit of trying out every new service or technology that comes along. Thatâ€™s fun, but in the case of online services, I wind up with accounts all over the place. So, the past few days Iâ€™ve been pruning my online accounts down to what I really need.</p>
