I"{<p>A couple of months ago Linux Magazine published an <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/4641">article</a> written by Scott Granneman comparing Mac OS X Leopard and Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon.  I’ve been torn between these two systems, and their respective predecessors for years, so the article was of great interest to me.  As a matter of fact, I was wondering how I missed it to begin with.  The article is well written, but can be boiled down to this one paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Linux has come a long way when it comes to ease of use, and it’s definitely getting better all the time, but overall Leopard is still ahead of Ubuntu (and both are way ahead of Vista). Apple makes mistakes, but overall its system is more logical, simple, consistent, and unified than Ubuntu, which still has too many elements that are overly complex, inconsistent, and fractured.</p>
