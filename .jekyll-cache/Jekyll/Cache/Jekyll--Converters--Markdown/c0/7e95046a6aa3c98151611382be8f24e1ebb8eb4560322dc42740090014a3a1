I"ò<p>Last night I did my civic duty by casting my vote at the local community center.  I walked down since it was not far from my house, and enjoyed the crisp night air.  Once I arrived at the community center I noticed that the voting process was being run by a group of elderly women, two of whom had Lenovo laptops, which were curiously tied together by an ethernet cable.  Each of the laptops had a label printer attached to it via USB, with the other USB port occupied by a mouse.  As I approached one lady noticed me and asked me to fill out a form, which I did, and then asked if I had voted there before, which I had not.  That turned out to be a bit of a problem, one that was easily resolved, and one that was caused entirely by the laptops.</p>
