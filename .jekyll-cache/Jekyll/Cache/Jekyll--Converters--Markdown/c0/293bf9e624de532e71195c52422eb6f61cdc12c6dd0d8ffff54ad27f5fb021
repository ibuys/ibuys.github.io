I"ò<p>I often daydream about <em>not</em> caring about my computer, and being able to go blissfully through my life with little concern about the mix of applications, storage of data, and how I interact with the machine, but thatâ€™s just a dream. The truth is I do care. I care a lot. I care enough that Iâ€™ve developed my own personal philosophy of computer use. I use this to determine which services and applications I will most likely be happy with. It helps me, maybe it will help you too.</p>
