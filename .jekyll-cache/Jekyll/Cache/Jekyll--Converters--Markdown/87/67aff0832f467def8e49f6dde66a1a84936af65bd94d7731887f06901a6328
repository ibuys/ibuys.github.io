I"Í<p>A few years ago I adopted <a href="http://macsparky.com/paperless/">David Sparksâ€™ paperless workflow</a>. I installed Hazel and TextExpander, bought a ScanSnap scanner, and started dutifully scanning all of my paper that came in the mail. I scanned the water bill, my bank statements, and notices from my sonâ€™s second grade teacher about upcoming snack days. Over the years, and 2000 documents later, Iâ€™ve got a massive database of useless facts.</p>
