I"¨<p>The Omni Groupâ€™s recent announcement that theyâ€™d have a subscription option for OmniFocus has me thinking about how Iâ€™m going to be handling third-party software in the future. Iâ€™m not angry at them, they are still (for now) offering OmniFocus for purchase, but I wonder how much longer theyâ€™ll want to keep with the old-style model of licensing when and if subscriptions turn out to be far more lucrative.</p>
