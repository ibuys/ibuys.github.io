<p>Iâ€™ve never been 100% happy with this site. On the one hand, Jekyll lets me have full control of my content, and I never have to worry about losing any of it or having anything locked inside a database on a server somewhere. On the other hand, things like adding media is more complicated than Iâ€™d like. Iâ€™ve written scripts to help, of course, but Iâ€™d really rather have the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve considered creating an application to manage this for me. Like <a href="https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> for Jekyll and GitHub Pages. A text editor with a git client and an understanding of Jekyll site structure. It could even let the user sign up for GitHub and setup the repository. I thought I might setup my old Paragraphs app to do this for meâ€¦Â I could tear out the site rendering code and replace it with a wrapper around a libgit2. But, the text editor in Paragraphs needs a lot of work, and there would be multiple parts of the app that would need considerable rework to get it to an even <em>barely functional</em> state. The other option would be to create a new app from scratch, but at this point if you arenâ€™t creating an iOS app in Swift when starting anew what are you even doing with your life? Problem is I donâ€™t know either Swift or iOS development. My skills in this area are basically outdated.</p>

<p>A search for â€œJekyllâ€ in the Mac App Store finds one result, for a â€œmarkup viewerâ€ app with dubious usefulness. A quick Duck search finds a couple people with the same idea, one that setup a web GUI, which is not at all what Iâ€™m talking about, and one that started something five years ago and never finished it. From what I can tell, the app that I want doesnâ€™t exist. Too bad <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a> and <a href="https://ia.net/writer">IA Writer</a> added support for Medium into their apps instead of GitHub pages.</p>

<p>So should I build this app or not? Itâ€™s basically a text editor that you can drop media on, hit publish, and have it push the site to GitHub. The same thing I have now, but automated, simple, and beautiful. Is there a market for this style of app? Would GitHub allow it? Could I learn the skills required to create it in a reasonable time? iOS development is supposed to be easier than macOSâ€¦ but Iâ€™m not sure that applies when youâ€™re carrying so much baggage around from the old style of development.</p>

<p>In the end, Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™d be worth the effort for me. Iâ€™ve already got a beautiful text editor, and my scripts and workflows make it simple for me to create and publish new posts. I think Iâ€™ve talked myself out of building this app myself, but darned if I wouldnâ€™t love for someone else to build it.</p>
