I"‡<p>Overcast is moving to an <a href="https://marco.org/2016/09/09/overcast-ads">ad-supported business model</a>.</p>

  <p>Ads are the great compromise: money needs to come from somewhere, and the vast majority of people choose free-with-ads over direct payment. Ads need not be a bad thing: when implemented respectfully, all parties can get what they want.</p>

<p>Overcast is the best podcast client Iâ€™ve used. Smart Speed and Voice Boost are fantastic features that Marco clearly put a lot of work into, so I hope he finds a business model that is sustainable enough to convince him to keep working on the app. Being able to say that though has taken some thought and introspection.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m envious of Marcoâ€™s success. Heâ€™s played all his cards right and heâ€™s designed the life he wants to lead; he deserves the success heâ€™s gained. ATP is my favorite podcast, and I used Instapaper almost religiously for years. Heâ€™s very good at what he decides to do, so I donâ€™t think itâ€™s any mystery at all that he is where he is.</p>

<p>And yetâ€¦ and yetâ€¦ like so many others in this community, Iâ€™ve struggled to come up with even one idea with staying power. Iâ€™ve released too soon, my ideas werenâ€™t very good, or my execution flawed. As I look at turning 40 in a few short months, Iâ€™m finding it harder than ever not to grow bitter at how some make it, but most do not. Itâ€™s an unfair, harsh, and unforgiving world out there, and if you werenâ€™t born with a silver spoon in your mouth itâ€™s unlikely youâ€™ll ever know life without struggle.</p>

<p>Unlikely, but not impossible. Thatâ€™s what I keep telling myself anyway.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve watched Shawn Blanc grow from a part-time blogger<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> to a self-help coach, running three separate sites and recording online courses. Making <a href="https://thefocuscourse.com/behind-the-scenes-six-figure-course-launch/">enough money in a week</a> to last for a year. Again, heâ€™s smart, heâ€™s found his niche, and heâ€™s worked hard. Itâ€™s just not the natural human emotion to feel good about others succeeding where you have not. It takes effort.</p>

<p>Manton Reece talked about this a bit in his post â€œ<a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/10/a-great-developer-can-come-from-anywhere.html">A great developer can come from anywhere</a>â€:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Daniel Jalkut and I had Marco as a special guest on <a href="http://coreint.org/200">Core Intuition 200</a> not just because heâ€™s a friend but also because he so well represents the goal that many of us have and our listeners have â€”Â to start our own company, to find success not just one time but again and again, and to have as thoughtful an approach as possible in the craft of software development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iâ€™m tempted to quote the entire article. Manton makes the case that while some people dismiss Marcoâ€™s approach to testing as a privilege he enjoys as a byproduct of his success, this concept is poison to the community. Saying â€œthatâ€™s fine for Marco, but it wouldnâ€™t work for the average guyâ€ is giving yourself an excuse not to work as hard or push as hard as needed to make it. Itâ€™s important to remember that Marcoâ€™s success came after years of mostly anonymous work. And of course, success breeds success, heâ€™s been able to build off of one to make a success of the next.</p>

<p>Manton ends his post by saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iâ€™ll never accept the implied negativity in the â€œthatâ€™s fine for Marcoâ€ argument. Iâ€™ll never accept that we should be jealous of another developerâ€™s success instead of inspired by it to do our best work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My first reaction to the Overcast announcement was to post a quick tweet about not wanting to help finance Marcoâ€™s next Tesla, but that would have come from a place of jealousy and bitterness, not inspiration. Instead, Iâ€™m going to go back to my notebook, my collection of ideas, and look over it again.</p>
