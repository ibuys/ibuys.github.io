I"@<p>In addition to my experiments with the design of this site, I was also testing out BBEdit as my main writing and programming tool. BBEdit didn’t stick, but I did like some of the scripting the good <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/11/markdown-table-scripts-for-bbedit/">Dr. Drang</a> has done, and wanted to adopt a few for MacVim. I started with three of his scripts today, one to paste and select text in one command, one to convert a tab-separated table to Markdown, and another to even up the Markdown table so it’s easier to read in plain text.</p>
