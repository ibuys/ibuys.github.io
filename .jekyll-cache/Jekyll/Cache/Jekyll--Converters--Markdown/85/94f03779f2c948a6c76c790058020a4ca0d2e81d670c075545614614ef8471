I"“<p>I realized today that itâ€™s been ten years since I dedicated an entire post to complaining about enterprise software. In that ten years not much has changed, unfortunately. Enterprise software is still crap, and itâ€™s still more of a hassle than itâ€™s worth. Itâ€™s best to avoid whenever possible, so when you find yourself evaluating software or services for your company, hereâ€™s a few easy markers to identify the products you should let pass by.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enterprise software doesnâ€™t want to tell you how much it costs.</li>
  <li>Enterprise software often doesnâ€™t even list what it does, instead it wantâ€™s to <em>partner</em> with you to provide <em>solutions</em>.</li>
  <li>Enterprise software doesnâ€™t provide you technical documentation until after youâ€™ve paid. And even then, itâ€™s lacking.</li>
  <li>Instead of real documentation, the marketing department of enterprise software vendors will write â€œwhitepapersâ€, which are entirely useless.</li>
  <li>The user-facing part of enterprise software is almost always complete garbage.</li>
</ol>

<p>This last point is important because it gets to the crux of what enterprise software is: software wherein the person who pays for it is not the person who uses it. Payment for these <em>solutions</em> is handled by managers who are several steps removed from the daily process of having to put the software in place and use it as intended. What the managers need is a way to justify the exorbitant fees enterprise software vendors charge, so the venderâ€™s sites are full of marketing jargon and various scenarios, hoping to inspire one manager to convince another manager that the price is worth it.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s almost always a better way to go about solving whatever problem an organization seeks out a vendor to solve. My personal preference is to solve it in house with open source software and custom development. That way, the money you would have spent on the garbage <em>solution</em> from an enterprise software vendor is spent investing in your own organization. Invest in yourself, solve your own problems, donâ€™t compound your problems by buying someone elseâ€™s.</p>
