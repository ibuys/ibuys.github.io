I"Ÿ<p>As the year comes to an end it would be easy to look back and see all of the things that didnâ€™t work. Mistakes were made, endeavors failed, and it was generally a tough year. Some things that I thought would work out did not, and some things I thought I had more time before I had to deal with came due. Sometimes, when things arenâ€™t working out, itâ€™s best to burn it all to the ground and start over.</p>
