I"Ž<p>David and Katie are great, they really are. Iâ€™ve enjoyed MPU, like most of you have, for years. Iâ€™ve bought the books, the scanners, implemented the workflows, heck, my paperless workflow is <em>still</em> a derivative of Davidâ€™s book. Most of all though, Iâ€™ve bought the apps. Lots of apps, and thereâ€™s a couple things to say about that.</p>

<p>For one, I like being part of the Mac community, always have, and I like supporting independent developers. Secondly, many times indie devs have more incentive to make their apps the best they can possibly be, and Iâ€™ve often found that the smaller, and older, the team, the higher quality the app. For example, BBEdit, MarsEdit, Keyboard Maestro, Acorn, etcâ€¦</p>

<p>However, thereâ€™s another aspect to this discussion. You donâ€™t buy your way into becoming a power user. You become a power user by understanding your Mac and knowing when and where buying an app makes sense in your personal workflow. Iâ€™d argue that if youâ€™re not writing code, BBEdit is probably not for you. If you donâ€™t already know that having a text expansion tool will save you hours of work every year, than it probably doesnâ€™t fit into your workflow and doesnâ€™t make sense to buy it.</p>

<p>Having a ton of system modification apps running doesnâ€™t make you a power user, but knowing which ones to run and why does. There are things macOS doesnâ€™t do that you might find useful in a third party app, but understanding the what, why, and how is the key.</p>

<p>And finally, and most importantly, have fun! In the end thatâ€™s what this is all about. Get your work done, do it efficiently, and have a good time doing it.</p>
