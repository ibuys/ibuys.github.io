I"Ô<p>I still have a soft spot in my heart for Firefox, but itâ€™s not my primary browser. I use Safari for just about everything, except the rare occasion when I <em>need</em> flash, then I use Chrome. Firefox is only used in the even rarer occasion that I need to use a site that Safari doesnâ€™t support properly. Since I use all three browsers, I keep an eye on new features and development, wondering if something new from Firefox will draw me away from Safari.</p>
