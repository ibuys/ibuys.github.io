I"‡<p>My phone went through the wash today. Â Turns out it happened first thing this morning. Â I really should be more careful about cleaning out my pockets before throwing something in the washing machine, but to be honest, I never liked that phone to begin with. Â It had a faulty battery, and a faulty USB charger, so it would almost never fully charge and when it did, it would drain quickly. Â The Bluetooth on it didnâ€™t work either. Â So, it wasnâ€™t that great of a phone, and now its gone, and good riddance to it. Â Now, Iâ€™m faced with the prospect of finding a replacement phone, but this comes with complications.</p>

<p>US Cellular has me for another 10 months. Â My contract doesnâ€™t end with them till November. Â I can cancelÂ my contract for $70, and I may wind up doing just that, but then Iâ€™ll also have to replace my wifeâ€™s phone as well. Â US Cellular is a good phone company, but when I think about spending money on a phone, its hard to justify purchasing anything other than an iPhone, which takes US Cellular out of the equation. Â Iâ€™m eligible for an â€œupgradeâ€ in May, when I can get a new phone for a reduced cost from US Cellular, but if I want a phone between now and then, Iâ€™m paying full price. Â Thatâ€™s $159.95 for a Samsung SCH-u340, which boasts an internal antenna and a VGA camera. Â When I look at that price, and think that I could get a refurbished iPhone for $9.95 &lt;it&gt;less&lt;/it&gt;, it makes my wallet hurt. Â </p>

<p>So, if I buy an iPhone, wonâ€™t I be chaining myself to massive monthly service charges from AT&amp;T? Â Well, maybe, maybe not. Â We pay right around $100/mo. for our service now. Â This is for 1000 minutes shared between our two phones. Â Looking at our phone bills, I find that we do not come anywhere close to using 1000 minutes. Â We would be perfectly suited to the At&amp;T 450 minute family plan, which is right around $60/mo. Â Couple this with the iPhoneâ€™s required $30/mo data plan, and we are at $90/mo. Â Of course, Iâ€™d have to have two data plansâ€¦ because thereâ€™s no way my wife would let me have an iPhone and not get her one as well, so thatâ€™d bring the grand total up to $120/mo. Â So, $20 more per month than what we are paying now. Â Since Iâ€™d have to cancel both of our accounts at US Cellular to get this to work, that would cost $140. Â The iPhones, even refurbished, would cost $300. Â So, for the first month, to get going, we are looking at $560. Â We are not poor, but we are not rich either, and that amount of money needs to be well thought out, which brings me to the basement.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve got an unfinished basement that Iâ€™m working on as time and money allows. Â Iâ€™ve built a couple of walls, made lots of plans, taken lots of measurements, and bought some tools. Â Iâ€™m a long, long way from being able to have a couple of my kids move their rooms down there. Â The basement is also where I have my desk, which holds my monitor and Time Machine drive, and where I do most of my programming at. Â Programming takes a lot of concentration, a lot of studying, and most of allâ€¦ lots and lots of time. Â Recently, Iâ€™ve been thinking that the unfinished basement would be much, much easier to concentrate in, if it were a little closer to being finished. Â </p>

<p>The phone going in the wash today has actually been a conduit for me re-aligning my priorities. Â Iâ€™m still very intent on finishing my application, but I think I would be more comfortable, and therefore be able to concentrate on development better, resulting in a better product, if I finish the basement first. Â Since Iâ€™m going to have to adjust the budget for the new phone, and since Iâ€™m going to need money to finish the basement, Iâ€™m thinking that the new phone is going to have to wait. Â Work gives me a cell phone every other week so I can be â€œon-callâ€. Â Normally I simply forward the phone over to my personal phone so I donâ€™t have to look like some kind of geek Batman carrying around a utility belt full of gadgets. Â Now, since I donâ€™t have a personal phone, Iâ€™ll just carry the one they give me. Â I suppose Iâ€™ll also have to start carrying the pager again. Â Yes, a pager, and party like itâ€™s 1989. Â </p>

<p>So, Iâ€™ll live without a cell phone for a while, and Iâ€™m also going to put development on hold for a while. Â Not entirely, Iâ€™ll still have a little time in the morning, but Iâ€™ll probably put that time to use blogging either here or over at The Apple Blog. Â The rest of my time, and the rest of my money, is going to go towards finishing the basement. Â After thatâ€™s done, Iâ€™ll be in a much better position to move to an iPhone, and finish developing Go in peace and comfort.</p>
