I"L<p>Marco Arment takes Apple to task over the decline in their software.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has completely lost the functional high ground. “It just works” was never completely true, but I don’t think the list of qualifiers and asterisks has ever been longer. We now need to treat Apple’s OS and application releases with the same extreme skepticism and trepidation that conservative Windows IT departments employ.</p>
