<p>A friend was explaining his preference for Googleâ€™s Chrome browser the other day, and was using 1Password as an example of why he felt that Chrome was a better designed browser. The 1Password extension in Chrome drops down a menu that looks almost like an iOS window, which he felt was more polished than itâ€™s Safari equivalent. In Contrast the â€œ1Pâ€ button in Safari drops down a normal cocoa menu. Funny thing is, Iâ€™m fairly certain that I had never seen that menu, simply because thatâ€™s not how I use Safari.</p>

<p>Chrome is an excellent browser, and got several things right with their design and philosophy, itâ€™s fast, light on resources, and I love that it separates tabs into their own processes. The one thing I think they got <em>spot on</em> right was the name. The browser is a pane of glass that the web shines through. When the browser starts outshining the web thereâ€™s an imbalance. The browser really is just the <em>chrome</em> around the content of the web, which is why I choose to hide all of Safariâ€™s toolbars.</p>

<p>I use Safari because it is a proper Mac app, and so it respects the standard keyboard combos that Iâ€™ve become used to over the years. I browse the web <em>almost</em> without touching the mouse. Almost, because I still use it to click links and to scroll down a page, but for the most part I use these keyboard combos:</p>

<ul>
  <li>âŒ˜ + [ = Back</li>
  <li>âŒ˜ + ] = Forward (I donâ€™t use this one much)</li>
  <li>âŒ˜ + L = Pop open the address bar to enter a URL</li>
  <li>âŒ˜ + F = Search for text in the current web page, immensely useful when searching for an answer to a technical question in a long newsgroup, mailing list, or forum page</li>
  <li>âŒ˜ +  âŒ¥ + F = Pop open the address bar with the cursor focused in the search field</li>
  <li>âŒ˜ + Shift + R = Safari Reader mode, inherited from Readability</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>And, for 1Password:</p>

<ul>
  <li>âŒ˜ + \ = Log in to the current web site</li>
  <li>âŒ˜ +  âŒ¥ + \ = Pops open a HUD window that lets you quickly select a saved login, then opens a new tab and logs into the web site for you.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>I also use bookmarklets fairly extensively, particularly <a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> and <a href="http://barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">Yojimbo</a>. Safari letâ€™s me use these keyboard combos to trigger bookmarklets I have saved in the Bookmarks bar. These change a bit more than the others, like once every six months or so, but hereâ€™s what I currently have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>âŒ˜ + 1 =	Instapaper Read Later Bookmarklet</li>
  <li>âŒ˜ + 2 =	Readability, for those few times when Safari Reader fails me</li>
  <li>âŒ˜ + 3 =	Bookmark in Go2, something special Iâ€™m working on for Go2 1.2 release</li>
  <li>âŒ˜ + 4 =	Share on Twitter, becauseâ€¦ wellâ€¦ you knowâ€¦</li>
  <li>âŒ˜ + 5 =	Archive in Yojimbo</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>As I said earlier, extensions can drag down a browser, clutter the interface, and generally do bad things. However, there are a few absolute gems that I keep around.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://stevenf.com/pages/shutup.css.html">Shut Up</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.verticalforest.com/youtube5-extension/">YouTube5</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.orbicule.com/incognito/">Incognito</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3372062/Safari%20Extensions/mTube/Index.html">uTube</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://jgn.heroku.com/2010/06/11/beautifier-my-safari-extension/">Beautifier</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://langui.sh/safari-extensions/">Optimize Legibility</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://davidbenjones.com/">Beautipedia</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/mfrelink/">Google Search Cleanup</a></li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>New windows and new tabs both open with Top Sites, which I think is just a beautiful home page. My current Top Sites are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://teuxdeux.com/list">TeuxDeux</a>: All the â€œtask managementâ€ I need</li>
  <li>iTunes Connect: To keep tabs on Go2</li>
  <li><a href="http://farmdogapps.com">Farmdog Software</a>: because Iâ€™m really happy with how the design turned out</li>
  <li>This site: Evidently because Iâ€™m my biggest fan</li>
  <li>5by5: Iâ€™m constantly checking the site to get to the links in the <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/2">shownotes</a>. I wish there was a separate RSS feed <em>just</em> for these links, thatâ€™d be pure gold.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/">FogBugz</a>: My bug tracker and customer support for Farmdog, also hosts Kiln, a Mercurial repository which keeps Go2â€™s source nice and cleanly revisioned.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Another part of Safari being a proper Mac app is itâ€™s support for the system-wide dictionary. One of my favorite features of Mac OS X is that I can highlight a word, press  âŒ˜ + ^ + D, and see that words definition in a little window below it. I use it constantly.</p>

<p>At this point iâ€™m fairly invested in Safari. Iâ€™ve tried other browsers, but Safari is the one I keep coming back to. Omniweb used to be my go to web slicing and dicing tool, but sadly, itâ€™s been leapfrogged. Safari lets me keep everything out of site, and just a quick keyboard press away. Everything I need, nothing I donâ€™t.</p>
