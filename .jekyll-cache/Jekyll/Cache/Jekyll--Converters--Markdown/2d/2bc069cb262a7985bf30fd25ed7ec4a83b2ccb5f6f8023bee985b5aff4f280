I"“<p>Last week I sent in the certificate of organization to recreate Farmdog as an LLC in the state of Iowa. I have the <a href="http://farmdog.co">domain name</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/farmdogco">twitter account</a>, and a <a href="http://fdtest.site44.com">test site</a> built. Assuming everything goes through with the state without problem, Farmdog Co. will be ready to launch very soon.</p>
