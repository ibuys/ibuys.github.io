I"{<p>You get good at something by doing it repeatedly. I’ve been writing on this site for six years now, but with little direction or topic. I’ve gotten good at <em>not</em> making anything of the site, which is not where I wanted to be when I wrote about why I kept this site <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/08-21-2011/Writing_Online.html">in 2011</a>. I’ve not kept to a regular schedule, or a common theme, so I am not surprised to see that the only traffic I have going to the site is my own, and a few that found the site from Google. The preceding statement will make the next seem a bit ridiculous, but bear with me.</p>
