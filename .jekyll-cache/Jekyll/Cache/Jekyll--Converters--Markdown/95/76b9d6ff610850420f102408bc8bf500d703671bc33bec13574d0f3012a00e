I"é	<p>The ability to visualize a complex system is key to a real understanding of it. To me, this applies to computers and technology. To <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=savants-cognition-thinking">Daniel Tammet</a>, this applies to numbers and letters, on a far, far more vast scale. Daniel is a savant, an extraordinary person who pushes the boundaries of what we believe we know about human capability and learning. What he has to say rings a bell, because how he views his numbers and letters is similar to how I understand the inner workings of a computer. I can visualize what is going on, or what I want to happen. I can do this because Iâ€™ve worked and studied the computer field for years, and because I enjoy the work. What Iâ€™ve found is that there is a distinct difference between understanding the technology and memorizing what happens when you click a button.</p>

<p>If you work in the tech industry, memorizing technology is a bad idea. Technology changes, it evolves and grows. It is better to understand the attitudes and purpose of the technology. Networking is a great example. I started out learning about wave propagation theory in the Navy, and about how we could get data from the size, shape, or velocity of the wave. Later, when I went on to learn TCP/IP networking, I found that the data was still transmitted the same way, as 0 or 1, but how it was decoded was different. Then the stack, then the applications, then scripting, and now, Iâ€™m learning a high level programming language, and its finally starting to click.</p>

<p>The thing is, I couldnâ€™t have learned these skills if I didnâ€™t have a visual image in my mind about how it worked under the gloss of the computer screen. I canâ€™t imagine trying to use a computer, much less program one, without at least a passing knowledge of what happens when you click that mouse.</p>

<p>Then again, to 99.999% of people, it doesnâ€™t matter, and really shouldnâ€™t. Computers should be so easy to use that you donâ€™t have to learn a new skill to use one effectively. They should be as self explanatory as toasters. Unfortunately, they are not. Windows 7 is coming out this year some time, and it will sport a new user interface which its users will have to learn all over again. Many, many of them will simply try to re-memorize what button does what, and what order to click things in. You shouldnâ€™t have to learn why the computer works the way it does, but it certainly doesnâ€™t hurt. In the end, it makes things much easier too.</p>
