I"i<p>Automator is one of my favorite tools on the Mac, and unfortunately one of the most unappreciated. I have several workflows and services that Iâ€™ve built up over the years, things that I could have turned to a third-party tool like Keyboard Maestro, Alfred, or even my beloved Quicksilver for, but I like the simplicity of using a built-in application.</p>
