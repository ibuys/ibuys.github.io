I"~<p>A couple years ago I started reading classic books to my boys before bedtime. We started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</a>, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a>, followed unsuccessfully by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea">Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</a> <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Next, we read one of my all time favorite books, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Island">Treasure Island</a>, the classic pirate story from which nearly all other tellings of pirates are cribbed. We might go back and read that one again someday.</p>

<p>We just finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_of_the_Wild,">The Call of the Wild</a> and decided to follow it up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Fang">White Fang</a>. Jack London was a brilliant writer; he brings his audience with him to the harsh northern lands, where the law of club and fang is the only law. Iâ€™m looking forward to White Fang. So far weâ€™ve only read the first chapter, but it starts out strong with two men, pursued by wolves, are returning the body of a third man from the snowy wilderness with a sled and six dogs.</p>

<p>Besides the books I read with the kids, I have a few <em>in progress</em> of my own. Iâ€™m reading through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maze_Runner">The Maze Runner</a>, mainly so I can talk it over with my younger daughter. Iâ€™m also reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_Riders">The Rough Riders</a>, the story of Theodore Rooseveltâ€™s time in the calvary during the Spanish-American War. Next on the list is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hateship,_Friendship,_Courtship,_Loveship,_Marriage">Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage</a> by Alice Munro. I picked this one up at the Half Price Bookstore because Munroâ€™s name is on a list of books, and the back cover looked interesting enough.</p>

<p>I also have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel)">The Martian</a> by Andy Weir, based on recommendation by <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/187/">The Incomparable</a>. Finally, I plan on finishing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick">Moby Dick</a> before summer, the Herman Melville classic thatâ€™s been on my mind to read for years. After finishing the four other books on my plate, Iâ€™m going to give that one my full attention.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m always looking for new book recommendations. I just add them to the list as they come in. I donâ€™t expect Iâ€™ll ever actually finish the list, it seems to grow faster than I can read, which is exactly what I want. I imagine myself as an old man someday, surrounded by books. <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Sometimes the books are fantastic, sometimes they are duds, but they always enrich my life in one way or another.</p>

<p>I consider myself a <a href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/asimov/">lifelong learner</a>. Reading is simply another aspect of my desire to constantly better myself.</p>

      <p>Iâ€™m a bit mystified by people who enjoy this book. My boys and I found it quite boring, and I wound up skipping large sections devoted to describing, in detail, the fish and other underwater life.Â <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Paper books. None of that ebook business. I like to own my books, and Iâ€™d rather they not run out of batteries.Â <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
