I"¶<p>I got up early this morning to take the dogs out. Made some coffee, had some breakfast, and woke up my MacBook to dig through my Music library a bit. I updated some smart playlists, removed some old music that Iâ€™m no longer into, and found a song that I love that I added to a favorite playlist. I saw a post on Kottke about<a href="https://kottke.org/20/01/bachs-prelude-to-cello-suite-no-1-deconstructed">Bachâ€™s Prelude to Cello Suite No. 1</a>, then found Yo Yo Maâ€™s performance of Bachâ€™s Cello Suite and listened to it while I looked over my Photos library.</p>

<p>I setup a few new smart albums, found some old photos that brought back good memories, and enjoyed the new Memories feature. Then I went to work on my iMac, and started listening to the updated Music playlist. I asked Siri to remind me to do something at a certain time, then checked my Calendar and noticed that it was set to remind me when to leave to make my first appointment. Then I launched Mail, noticed a PR, and popped open Terminal to get started on the day.</p>

<p>I spend the majority of my working life behind the Macâ€™s screen, and use most of itâ€™s bundled apps. If it really was rotting, Iâ€™d notice.</p>
