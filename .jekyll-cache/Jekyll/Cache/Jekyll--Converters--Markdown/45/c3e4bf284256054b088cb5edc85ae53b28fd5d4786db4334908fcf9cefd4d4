I"•<p>I woke this morning at 5:20, got dressed, and went outside for my morning
workout. Todayâ€™s weather was beautiful, perfect temperature, and the smell of
fresh rain. Lately Iâ€™ve been riding my bike, a Schwinn that is neither strong
enough to be a mountain bike, nor sleek enough to be a road bike. I would call
it a â€œsmall town bikeâ€, as it gets me around all four corners of our small
town.</p>
