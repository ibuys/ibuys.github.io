I"±<p>A few years ago I adopted <a href="http://macsparky.com/paperless/">David Sparksâ€™ paperless workflow</a>. I installed Hazel and TextExpander, bought a ScanSnap scanner, and started dutifully scanning all of my paper that came in the mail. I scanned the water bill, my bank statements, and notices from my sonâ€™s second grade teacher about upcoming snack days. Over the years, and 2000 documents later, Iâ€™ve got a massive database of useless facts.</p>

<p>Never once have I actually <em>needed</em> to go back and look at what my home phone bill was last September. Even less have I needed to know what the schedule was for March in the third-grade classroom. I became so enamored by the ability to save everything that I stopped thinking about what I actually needed to save. I was hoarding.</p>

<p>Like any hoarder, I justified my activities. Why did I spend an hour every other week scanning things into my Mac? Why, for the most basic reason of allâ€¦ <em>I might <strong>need</strong> that someday!</em> Eventually my Spotlight searches became nearly useless, as every keyword was littered with results from my OCRâ€™d scans, useless information I didnâ€™t need to keep.</p>

<p>So, today I staged an intervention for myself. I archived everything and started from scratch<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. With <a href="http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/3177/how-long-should-i-keep-my-bills">the help of stackexchange</a>, I now have a sane plan for what to keep and for how long. Some things will still get scanned, like reciepts for large purchases and the kids artwork that we canâ€™t bear to part with. For the most part though, the paper will come in, live in my drawer for a month or so, and then move on out.</p>

<p>The new system will take some getting used to, but in the end I think Iâ€™ll be happier and better organzied for it. Thereâ€™s no need to keep things Iâ€™m never going to look at again, physically or digitally.</p>
