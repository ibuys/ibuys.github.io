I"W<p>I was listening to <a href="http://www.coreint.org">Core Intuition</a> a few weeks back and Manton said that if anyone was interested in his project to let him know, and he would send a couple of stickers. I was interested, so I emailed him a quick note, and quickly forgot about it.</p>

<p>Yesterday an envelope arrived in the mail with two stickers and a handwritten note. Iâ€™m looking forward to his new project, that <a href="http://www.manton.org">Manton Reece</a> seems like a stand-up guy.</p>
