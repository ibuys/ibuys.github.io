I"¦<p>Part of a Farmdog project Iâ€™m working on needs nice syntax highlighting for markdown. After searching around for a bit I found Ali Rantakariâ€™s <a href="http://hasseg.org/peg-markdown-highlight/">PEG Markdown Highlight</a> project, and knew that it would be a perfect fit. Unfortunately, the code was not written for <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html">ARC</a>, or Automatic Reference Counting, and my project was. Rantakariâ€™s code worked fantastic outside of ARC, but inside it needed a few days worth of love and attention.</p>

<p>I tried to dig through and fix the errors in my project, but after a while it seemed like a better idea to rip it out, start a blank Xcode project and do all of the fixing there. Thus, <a href="https://github.com/jbuys/ArcDown">ArcDown</a> was born.</p>

<p>ArcDown is a reference project, intended to be an example of how to use the PEG Markdown Highlight in your project. Itâ€™s far from perfect, not even close to finished, and is not going to replace MacVim for me any time soon, but it is a fun project to work on at night. If you are interested, ArcDown is released under the MIT license, so, fork away.</p>
