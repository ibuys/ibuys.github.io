I"<p>After reading through Matt Gemmellâ€™s <a href="http://www.mattgemmell.co.uk/the-dao-of-the-shell/">latest post</a> on mutt and the good doctorâ€™s <a href="http://leancrew.com/all-this/2016/01/filing-mail/">response</a>, I fired up my old mutt config and gave it another run through. Well, after being a bit snarky on <a href="https://twitter.com/ibuys/status/689227413037969408">Twitter</a>, of course.</p>
