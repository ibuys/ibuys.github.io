I" <p>After reading the MacSparky piece on craftsmanship, Iâ€™m reminded of how I like to look at my career as a <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/05-14-2008/the-master-craftsman.html">systems administrator</a>. I find that there are times when things that are not quite right just <em>bother</em> me. Like when there are inconsistencies or one-offs scattered throughout the environment I am responsible for. There may well be perfectly logical reasons why some systems are monitored and some are not, why some are registered with configuration management and others are not, but in my mind it is these little inconsistencies that add up and make your work look sloppy.</p>
