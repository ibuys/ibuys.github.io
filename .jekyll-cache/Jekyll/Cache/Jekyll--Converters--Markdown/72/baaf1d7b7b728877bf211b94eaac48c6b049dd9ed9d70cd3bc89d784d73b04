  <p>See, I was recently commissioned to come up with a redesign of the calendar and note-taking app Opus One and I was excited to share this particular bit of work‚Äî not only because I really liked how it came out, but because it represented the sort of work I have always loved doing: Themed UI carefully crafted to create a memorable experience through textures, lighting and dimensionality. A UI that is fun, takes cues from the real world for context and aims to be delightful, simply for the sake of invoking a feeling in the user.</p>

  <p>In other words; <em>a skeuomorphic design</em>.</p>

<p>I think this looks great, and the concept is in keeping with how I think of my devices as ‚Äúdigital notebooks‚Äù. The clean iOS 7 style is fine, but I do think that both macOS and iOS have lost some of the whimsical touches that made Apple design stand out. Like the wormhole background in Time Machine. Completely unnecessary, but it always made me smile.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/opus-one/id940668697?mt=12">Opus One</a> is an app that I personally need, but if more design like this started making it‚Äôs way back into iOS, I‚Äôd be all right with that.</p>
