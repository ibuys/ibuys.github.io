I"×<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Setting up a new Mac can be fun, but time consuming too. As I scan the icons in my dock, I see several that will not be there when I upgrade to Mountain Lion. As well compartmentalized as OS X is, and as well as it handles applications, I still like to keep things as clean as possible.</p>

<p>Part of keeping things clean is using the applications that ship with OS X. I use Safari for my browser, with my own <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/01-27-2011/Keyboard_Driven_Safari.html">setup</a>, Mail for Email, iChat for instant messaging, and iCal for my calendar. All of my music is in iTunes, including my Grateful Dead collection. If Apple shipped a decent Twitter client and RSS feed reader, Iâ€™d use those too, but since they donâ€™t, this is where my short list of third party applications starts.</p>

<p>For Twitter, I like using <a href="http://hibariapp.com/">Hibari</a>. It is a very simple and clean application, and I love the <a href="http://violasong.com/2012/01/hibari-design-philosophy">design philosophy</a> behind it. I do wish it had a few extra features, like viewing someoneâ€™s profile in the app, or showing photographs similarly to the way the Twitter desktop app does it, but other than that I really like it.</p>

<p>My RSS feeds are all in <a href="http://netnewswireapp.com/">NetNewsWire</a>, synced to Google Reader. Checking my list I see that Iâ€™m subscribed to 26 carefully selected sites. This list is continually revised, and if I find one that is not holding my interest as well as Iâ€™d like, it gets dropped from the list.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html">DEVONthink</a> as my <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2009/09/yojimbo-and-anything-buckets/">anything bucket</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-10/st_thompson/">outboard brain</a>. Iâ€™ve gone back and forth between DEVONthink, Evernote, and Yojimbo, but find DEVONthink gives me the features that I want, without reliance on some amorphous cloud.</p>

<p>This is where things start to get a little geeky. I initially intended for this to be a single post, but as I write, it seems like it would be better to break it down into a series of smaller posts, each dedicated to a single app. Below is the list of apps that I use on a daily basis, and each has a story.</p>

<h2 id="quicksilver">Quicksilver</h2>

<p>Quicksilver is the king of productivity hacks for the Mac. Few applications can claim to have the impact on how a person uses their computer more than Quicksilver. At itâ€™s most base form, Quicksilver is an application launcher, but it is also so much more than that. Setup however, takes a bit of work.</p>

<p>First, grab some plugins from Quicksilverâ€™s preferences panel. The important ones, to me, are <em>â€œUser Interface Pluginâ€</em>, <em>â€œClipboard Pluginâ€</em>, <em>â€œ1Password Plugin</em>â€, and <em>â€œWeb Search Module</em>â€. You can see the full list that I currently use in the screenshot below.</p>

<p><a href="/media/qsprefs.png"><img src="/media/qsprefs_thumb.png" /></a></p>

<p>Next, select the â€œCatalogâ€ tab, then the â€œQuicksilverâ€ item from the left view, and enable <em>â€œInternal Commandsâ€</em>, <em>â€œInternal Objectsâ€</em>, and <em>â€œProxy Objectsâ€</em>. These sources give Quicksilver some very interesting abilities. Click on the â€œCustomâ€ item from the left view, and click the plus icon on the bottom and select â€œWeb Search Listâ€. In the drawer that opens on the right, click the plus icon and edit the â€œNameâ€ field to be <em>â€œddgâ€</em>, and the URL field to be:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>https://duckduckgo.com/?q=***
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now select the â€œTriggersâ€ section of the preference pane, and click the plus icon on the bottom, then select â€œHotKeyâ€, and in the field marked â€œSelect an itemâ€ type <em>â€œddgâ€</em>, and then tab to the next field and type <em>â€œSearch Forâ€</em>. Next, tab to the â€œTargetâ€ field, which will automatically be populated with text. We do not want this text in our trigger, so we will right click on this field and select â€œRemoveâ€. Now click â€œSaveâ€.</p>

<p><a href="/media/ddg_setup.png"><img src="/media/ddg_setup_thumb.png" /></a></p>

<p>Double-click on the â€œHotKeyâ€ field to open up a drawer on the right hand side of the preferences window and assign your preferred hot key. I prefer Option-Space. Now, whenever I type my hotkey, Quicksilver opens with the third text panel open ready for me to type my DuckDuckGo search for whatever Iâ€™m looking for. When I hit return, Quicksilver opens Safari with my search results, and since I use DuckDuckGo, I use the vi keyboard commands to navigate the results, and Command-Return to open the selected results in a background tab.</p>

<p>Click the plus button at the bottom of the Triggers panel to create a new custom trigger. Type <em>â€œCurrent Applicationâ€</em>, then tab to the next panel and type <em>â€œShow Menu Itemsâ€</em> and click â€œSaveâ€. Double-click the â€œHotKeyâ€ field again, and assign a new key combo to this trigger. I prefer Control-Space. This trigger gives us quick access to the menu items of whatever application has focus at the time. For example, I use it quite a bit in <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a> to group items. Any application that makes heavy use of menu items (like Photoshop) is a great fit for this trigger.</p>

<p><a href="/media/current_app.png"><img src="/media/current_app_thumb.png" /></a></p>

<p>Create another custom trigger, but this time type <em>â€œShow Clipboardâ€</em>. The default action should be <em>â€œRunâ€</em>, so save this command and assign it a key combo. I use Shift-Command-V. Make sure you are capturing your clipboard history in the Preferences tab.</p>

<p>It is worth spending some time in the preferences, actions, and triggers portions of Quicksilverâ€™s configuration. There be gold in dem hills. Iâ€™ve covered what portions of Quicksilver I use, but it can do much, much more. Now that it is under rapid development again, I look forward to many more years of use.</p>
