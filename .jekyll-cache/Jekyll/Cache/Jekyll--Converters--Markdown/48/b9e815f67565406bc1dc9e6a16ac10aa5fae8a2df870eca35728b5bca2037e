  <p>I, of course, am stuck in the past, not willing to give upâ€”or even shareâ€”the ownership of my words. Still clinging to a publishing model that may soon be as outdated as print. Erikâ€™s hybrid system is probably the right way to accomodate the new realities while still maintaining control. But Iâ€™m not a fan of the new realities. I know the niche Iâ€™ve carved out is vanishingly small, but itâ€™s all mine.</p>
