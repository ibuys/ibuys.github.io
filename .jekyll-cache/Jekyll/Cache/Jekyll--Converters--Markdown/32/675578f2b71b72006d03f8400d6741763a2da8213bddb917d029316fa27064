I"–	<p><a href="https://www.relay.fm/topfour">Top Four</a> is one of my favorite podcasts. Possibly my number one, although its probably tied with <a href="http://atp.fm">ATP</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a>. Itâ€™s a strong contender. Marco and Tif Arment chat about some random group of things, and attempt to rank said things, usually failing because they canâ€™t make up their minds. Itâ€™s adorable. Itâ€™s clear that the two of them are having a good time, and listening always makes me laugh.</p>

<p>In a recent episode the pair ranked their top four favorite â€œFall-tivitiesâ€, things to do in the Fall. They named a few things Iâ€™d never heard of, like pumpkin blazing, which sounds like a lot of fun, and talked about the corn mazes in the Northeast, which for some reason sound bigger than ours here in Iowa. A travesty if true.</p>

<p>Listening to the podcast put me in the holiday mood early this year, and since itâ€™s good to think about good things that make us happy, here, in no particular order, here are a few of my favorite things about Fall.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flannels, sweaters, and jackets</li>
  <li>Getting a chill outside and coming inside to warm up under a blanket with a hot drink</li>
  <li>Apple pie</li>
  <li>The smell of cinnamon and spice in the air when baking said apple pie</li>
  <li>Also pumpkin pie</li>
  <li>Pumpkins on peoples porches</li>
  <li>The leaves changing color and falling</li>
  <li>The holiday season is coming, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years ğŸğŸ‰ğŸŠ</li>
  <li>Getting up before the sun comes up and going outside to look at the stars</li>
  <li>Soups, stews, and chili</li>
  <li>Smores in the backyard over a fire, just because.</li>
  <li>Football and Fall soccer seasons</li>
  <li>The long, hot, miserable summer is over. The seasons change, life goes on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fall is by far my favorite time of the year. The grass stops growing, but we donâ€™t have snow yet. The days get shorter, but thereâ€™s still plenty of sunshine. Time to break out the gloves and hats and scarves. Time to bake some cookies and carve a pumpkin. Run a little later in the day, and enjoy it more because the temperature is perfect for running in long sleeves. Go for a hayride, have a bonfire, dig the decorations out of storage. Put our petty differences aside and remember that we are all neighbors. Give, laugh, love. Fall is the best.</p>
