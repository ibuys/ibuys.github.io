<blockquote>
  <p>The advantage to using Linode is that since itâ€™s a virtual server, rather than a VPN service, Iâ€™m completely in charge of the setup and configuration of the VPN server. Again, this isnâ€™t foolproof, because my traffic is only encrypted between my Mac and the Linode server, meaning that if Linode decided it wanted to track my outbound traffic, then Iâ€™d be in much the same boat as before. (Essentially, Linode becomes my de facto ISP.) Given, however, that Linodeâ€™s main business is hosting, and that they have their own pretty strong privacy policy, Iâ€™m not particularly concerned on that point. But, again, thatâ€™s subject to the vagaries of business.</p>

<p>In reference to <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/Beware_of_VPNs">my previous post</a> on the subject, this is the only method of using a VPN for privacy that I can recommend.</p>
