I"§<p>Itâ€™s nearly midnight on Christmas Eve. Iâ€™m the only one awake, perhaps with the exception of my dog, Oliver, although as the minutes tick by Iâ€™m less sure of him. Tomorrow morning the kids will wake us up earlier than weâ€™d like, and we will tear into the presents, eat a wonderful breakfast, and have a fantastic day enjoying each others company.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas everyone, and have a happy new year.</p>
