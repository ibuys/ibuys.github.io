  <p>We will make Vesper for iOS, Vesper for Mac, and Vesperâ€™s JavaScript sync service open source on my personal GitHub account. This code will also be provided as historical artifacts: theyâ€™re not intended as active projects. Theyâ€™re also not intended as examples of how to write apps these days.</p>

<p>I applaud the teamâ€™s decisions to open source the Vesper code base, especially the syncing component that Brent put so much work into. Perhaps, like the ill-fated <a href="https://github.com/ccgus/letters">Letters.app</a>, Vesperâ€™s demise will give way to new applications that may fare better.</p>
