I"ê<p>I‚Äôve heard several people on podcasts or blog posts claim that they‚Äôd like to see Apple hold off on new features that nobody wants and just fix the existing bugs in the Mac. This claim is normally followed up with a missive that they can‚Äôt imagine what Apple could add to the Mac at this point anyway, since macOS is a stable, mature operating system. Well, I can think of a few things.</p>
