<p>All writing on this site is done using Markdown in <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a> on a 2017 iMac 5k. The site is generated by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, and hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. This site uses no plugins, no javascript, and has no tracking capability. You can <a href="https://github.com/ibuys/ibuys.github.io">view the source</a> to verify.</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>This site uses my own theme, but the design is based heavily off of <a href="http://inessential.com">Inessential</a>, by Brent Simmons. I appreciated his bare-bones approach to web design and blogging, so I learned what I could from right-clicking and viewing source. Hopefully, he seems this as the sincerest form of flattery that it is.</p>

<p>I name all my computers after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_Generation_1">first generation transformers</a>, and my main machine is always Prime. I think a lot about questions that are hard to answer. What is being a full-time connected society doing to us? How can we use new technology for good, how can we make the world a better place?</p>

<h3 id="personal">Personal</h3>

<p>I love meeting new people, and especially love good conversation. If you’d like to get in touch, you can find me on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/ibuys">@ibuys</a>. If you are ever around the Midwest, drop me a line and I’ll show you the best coffee shop in town.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</p>
