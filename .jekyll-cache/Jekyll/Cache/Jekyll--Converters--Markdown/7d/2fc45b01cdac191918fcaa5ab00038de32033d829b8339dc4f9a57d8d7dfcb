I"ž<p>Iâ€™m in the process, a very long process, of switching from Vim to BBEdit as my primary editor. The reasons are long and varied, but boil down to me being tired of screwing around with Vimâ€™s configuration. I do a lot of work in Python now, and Iâ€™m using the experience of building and maintaining cloudchain to learn how to navigate BBEdit. Hopefully, someday Iâ€™ll be as good here as I was with Vim.</p>
