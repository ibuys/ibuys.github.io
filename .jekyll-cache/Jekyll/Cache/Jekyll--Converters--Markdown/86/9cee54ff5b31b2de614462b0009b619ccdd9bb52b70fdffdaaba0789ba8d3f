I"«<p>Itâ€™s been nine years since I first installed Linux on a computer of mine. It didnâ€™t last long back then, since I actually wanted to use the computer for surfing the web, sending email, and playing games. Linux has come a long way since then, and now itâ€™s a reliable desktop system at work. However, my system is reliable (and enjoyable) because I am a geek, and I know exactly what it needs to make it run smooth.</p>
