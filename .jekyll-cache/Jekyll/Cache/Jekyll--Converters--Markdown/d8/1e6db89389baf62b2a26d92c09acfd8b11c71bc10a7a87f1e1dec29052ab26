I"Ü<p>I should have known betterâ€¦ I do know better, but it was on sale, and it was Black Friday, and I bought an Android phone.  I purchased the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2f3jfhm">HTC Desire</a>, a perfectly reasonable choice in high-end smart phones.  Android 2.1, a 1GHz processor, 512M of RAM, and an 8G MicroSD card for storage.  The phone is well designed, solidly built, and aesthetically pleasing, but at this point, its still on probation, I might take it back.</p>
