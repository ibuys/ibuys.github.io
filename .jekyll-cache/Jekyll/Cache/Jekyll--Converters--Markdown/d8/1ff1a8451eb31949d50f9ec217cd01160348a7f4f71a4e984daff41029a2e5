I"„<p>Desktop wallpaper is a cheap trick. Itâ€™s only purpose is to make your computer screen look <em>pretty</em>, but I have yet to come across a photo or a work of art that I found to be anything but distracting. There is very little difference between UI elements like windows and objects depicted in a picture behind the windows. If you can see it, your brain needs to identify it.</p>
