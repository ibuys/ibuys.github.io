I"»<p>A couple years ago I started reading classic books to my boys before bedtime. We started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</a>, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a>, followed unsuccessfully by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea">Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</a> <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Next, we read one of my all time favorite books, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Island">Treasure Island</a>, the classic pirate story from which nearly all other tellings of pirates are cribbed. We might go back and read that one again someday.</p>

      <p>Iâ€™m a bit mystified by people who enjoy this book. My boys and I found it quite boring, and I wound up skipping large sections devoted to describing, in detail, the fish and other underwater life.Â <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
