I"ÿ<p>Sometimes itâ€™s a miracle the Internet works at all. For the past week or so Iâ€™ve been unable to clone, pull from, or push to private Git repositories from either Bitbucket or Github using the normal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone git@bitbucket.org:whatever/whatevs.git</code> syntax. The problem had the symptoms of a blocked port or a bad network route; Iâ€™d issue the command in Terminal and wait, and wait, and wait, and the command would eventually timeout. After a quick look at the Github documentation I tried <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh -T git@github.com</code> which also timed out and confirmed my suspicions. The ssh protocol was not getting through, but VPN and normal web traffic was.</p>
