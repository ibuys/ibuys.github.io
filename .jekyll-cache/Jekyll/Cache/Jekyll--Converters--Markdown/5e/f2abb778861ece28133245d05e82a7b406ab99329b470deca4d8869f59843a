I"Š<p>I spent some time over the past couple nights adopting a new theme for the old digs here at jb. I found the <a href="https://github.com/nielsenramon/chalk">beautiful Chalk theme</a> by Nielsen Ramon and adopted my site to use it, including, finally, a working tags system. Iâ€™m quite happy with the tags, but Iâ€™m less happy with the bundled deployment system the theme shipped with.</p>
