I"<p>It appears Iâ€™ll be getting a new Mac soon, which means itâ€™s time to take inventory of what I need. Iâ€™ve written about this a <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/2008/11/04/essentials.html">couple</a> of <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/2012/07/19/New_Mac_Essentials.html">times</a> before, and itâ€™s interesting to look back and see what apps stick, and which have gone by the wayside.</p>
