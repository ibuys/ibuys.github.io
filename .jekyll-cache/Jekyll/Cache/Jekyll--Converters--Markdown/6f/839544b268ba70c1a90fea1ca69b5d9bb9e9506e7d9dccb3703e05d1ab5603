I"İ<p>Via a post I saw today from <a href="http://chrisbowler.com/journal/wrong-dictionary">Chris Bowler</a>, via a newsletter by <a href="https://www.sarahjbray.com">Sarah Bray</a>, discussing an article written by <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary">James Somers</a>, wherein he describes the writing process of <a href="http://jsomers.net/mcphee-draft-no-4.pdf">John McPhee</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, and how he uses a good dictionary to go from last draft to finished work. The emphasis here is on a <em>good</em> dictionary, namely the 1913 Websterâ€™s Unabridged. I wonâ€™t attempt to describe how wonderful the dictionary is here, James did a fantastic job of that on his <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary">blog five years ago</a>. I will however say that I think his installation instructions for getting the dictionary usable on your Mac are out of date. Hereâ€™s the easy way to do it.</p>

<p>First, download the compiled dictionary text. I downloaded it from a GitHub account, but who knows for how long thatâ€™ll be available, so Iâ€™m hosting the download here<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/media/Webster.s.1913.dictionary.zip">Webster.s.1913.dictionary.zip</a></p>

<p>Next, unzip the downloaded file and find the file named â€œWebsterâ€™s 1913.dictionaryâ€. Click on the Finderâ€™s â€œGoâ€ menu and hold down the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">âŒ¥</code>Option key to show the hidden â€œLibraryâ€ folder. Click on Library, and find the â€œDictionariesâ€ folder. Open it, and drag and drop the new dictionary folder into it.</p>

<p>Now when you open the macOS Dictionary app, you can go into the settings (either by pressing âŒ˜, or by clicking on â€œDictionaryâ€ then â€œPreferencesâ€¦â€ in the menu bar), scroll down a bit till you find â€œWebsterâ€™s 1913â€, click the check box next to it and drag it to the top of the list. Uncheck the â€œNew Oxford American Dictionaryâ€. Now when you click on a word in a good Mac app, then click just a <em>tad</em> bit harder<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, youâ€™ll get the definition from the new and improved Websterâ€™s. Itâ€™ll also show up in Spotlight searches, and anywhere else the system-wide dictionary is used.</p>

<p>Now you have a far richer and more useful dictionary. A useful resource if you happen to currently be, or soon will be, a college student who needs to write often, and in volume.</p>

      <p>Good grief!Â <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Which, ironically, is also hosted on GitHub.Â <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>If your Mac doesnâ€™t have the force-press feature in the trackpad, you can hit âŒ˜âŒƒD while a word is highlighted to get the definition as well.Â <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
