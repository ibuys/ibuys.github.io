I"ð<p>Weâ€™ve been having a months long discussion at work around which Linux OS to
use. Itâ€™s all come to a head recently, and it looks like the winner is going
to be Red Hat. The decision leaves a slightly sour taste in my mouth, but over
the course of the past year Iâ€™ve gotten used to having it around. While trying
to understand why Iâ€™ve got such a dislike for this particular flavor of Linux,
I thought it might help to take another look at <a href="http://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>.</p>
