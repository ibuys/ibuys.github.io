I"c<p>Living out in the farmland of Iowa where we do, thereâ€™s really only one carrier who provides decent service, <a href="http://www.uscellular.com/uscellular/cell-phones/showPhones.jsp?type=phones&amp;phone-selector-category=phone-selector-android&amp;_requestid=765022">US Cellular</a>.  US Cellular has a great service for battery replacement.  If you find yourself out and about and your battery dies, you can drop by any US Cellular store and they will replace the battery for free.  I was in that situation today, so I spent some time looking at the Android phones HTC Desire and Samsung Mesmerize.</p>
