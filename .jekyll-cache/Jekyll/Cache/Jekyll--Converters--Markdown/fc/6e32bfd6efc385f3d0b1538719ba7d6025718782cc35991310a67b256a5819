  <p>I could see that my 9-to-5 job wasnâ€™t my destiny. It didnâ€™t fulfill me or stimulate significant personal growth. It wasnâ€™t that I was bored, but it was more like feeling out of placeâ€”I could and should do more with my talents.</p>

<p>I know the feeling. Right now Iâ€™ve never been happier with where I am in my career, but the feeling Kevin describes is how I felt for seven years at my previous job. I felt like I was slowly atrophying in that cubicle. Today, after making the jump to a much smaller company where I have much more responsibility, I feel like Iâ€™m doing the best work of my life. It was scary, but worth it.</p>
