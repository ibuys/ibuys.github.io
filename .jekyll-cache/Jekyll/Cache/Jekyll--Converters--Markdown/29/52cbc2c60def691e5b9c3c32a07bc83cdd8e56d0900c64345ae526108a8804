I"Ç<p>We humans are complicated creatures. I run for miles at a time, even though Iâ€™ve got nowhere to go, and nothing is chasing me, nothing but time and old age. Some people collect stamps, others watch birds; thereâ€™s no end to the ways that we occupy our time. Some people write stories, or draw, or paint, or make pottery out of clay. Some people write poetry. My daughter, my oldest, spends her time practicing the ancient art of <em>dance</em>.</p>
