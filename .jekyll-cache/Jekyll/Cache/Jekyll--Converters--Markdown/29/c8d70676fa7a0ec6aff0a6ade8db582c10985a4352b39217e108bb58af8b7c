It was while I was mulling over the affect of technology on our society that I watched the most recent Apple event where they released an updated MacBook Air, Mac Mini, and a new line of iPad Pros. The Air and the Mini look great, although itâ€™s too bad that they are more expensive than previous models. What really caught my attention though were the iPads.</p>
