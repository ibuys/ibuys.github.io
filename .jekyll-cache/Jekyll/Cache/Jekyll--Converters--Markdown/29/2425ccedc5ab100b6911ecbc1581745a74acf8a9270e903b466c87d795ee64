I"ü<p>My workout this morning called for five miles. Run two, walk one, run the last two. I think in the Fall or Spring it would have been fairly easy, but today, in the July heat and humidity, every step felt like dragging a pair of anchors. My muscles gave out sooner, my breath ran out fasterâ€¦ it was a hard workout. I finished it though, because what Iâ€™ve learned is that even when itâ€™s hard, even when you are having a tough time and not going as fast as youâ€™d like, you always have to finish.</p>
