I"X<p>Monday I was offered a new position, yesterday I accepted it. I’m hoping that this is the last time I’ll have to look for a job for a very, <em>very</em> long time. Having an unexpected change in  your career and having to search for a new job is one of the most stressful things a person can do. It was hard, I didn’t sleep well.</p>
