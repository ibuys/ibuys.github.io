I"h<p>Since writing <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/01-27-2011/Keyboard_Driven_Safari.html">Keyboard Driven Safari</a> I’ve updated my list of extensions that make Safari my browser of choice.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://stevenf.com/pages/shutup.css.html">Shut Up</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.verticalforest.com/youtube5-extension/">YouTube5</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3372062/Safari%20Extensions/mTube/Index.html">uTube</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.orbicule.com/incognito/">Incognito</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://jgn.heroku.com/2010/06/11/beautifier-my-safari-extension/">Beautifier</a></li>
  <li>
    <strike>[Optimize Legibility][7]</strike>
    <p><em>update: Optimize Legibility seems to have some performance issues. My Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/oldmanuk">Dominic Evans</a> for pointing this out.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://davidbenjones.com/">Beautipedia</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://dbergey.github.com/">Type-To-Navigate</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://dbergey.github.com/">Invisible Status Bar</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The combination of shutup.css, YouTube5, and uTube makes for a great experience viewing videos on YouTube. No comments, a very nicely centered layout, and high-quality 720p h.264 video. Beautifier and Optimize Legibility are both very small, and insert some simple css into each page to enhance typography and font rendering for a better reading experience on sites that may not think of these things on their own.</p>

<p>When reading a Wikipedia article on my MacBook, the experience is similar to using Instapaper  on my iPad, thanks to Beautipedia. Absolutely gorgeous. I’m not entirely sure I need Incognito, but the idea of being tracked by some gigantic, faceless corporate entity just feels wrong. Incognito blocks Google Adsense and Google Analytics, as well as Facebook tracking.</p>

<p>The next two extensions are new to the list: Type-To-Navigate and Invisible Status Bar, both by Daniel Bergey. Type-To-Navigate lets me type the characters in a link, and hit the return key to “click” the link. Previous to installing this extension, I would use the Safari “find” feature to quickly find a specific link on a page, and then click on the link with the mouse. Type-To-Navigate removes two steps from the process, and the results are fantastic.</p>

<p>Invisible Status Bar borrows from Chrome, and allows me to hide the status bar, while still being able to hover over a link to see the full URL. Very nice to have when reading through long text, and deciding if a link is worth following or not.</p>

<p>The last extension I use is the fantastic <a href="http://agilebits.com/products/1Password">1Password</a>. 1Password is the one of the first three apps I install on a new Mac, and the first I install on a new iOS device.</p>

<p>Dropped from the list is Google Search Cleanup. I’ve switched most of my search to <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>, thanks to outstanding keyboard navigation (it supports vi keyboard bindings for navigation). DuckDuckGo is a very small operation taking on giants, I can’t help but root for the underdog.</p>
