I"^<p>Today, the team I’m a part of at TargetSmart is releasing our <a href="https://github.com/targetsmart-devops/cloudchain">first open source project</a>, a bit of Python I like to call “cloudchain”. cloudchain is designed to make it easy to store and retrieve secrets using AWS. cloudchain relies on the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/?tag=duckduckgo-osx-20">Key Management Service</a> (KMS) to securely store and manage access to encryption keys, and stores the encrypted secret in a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">DynamoDB</a> table.</p>
