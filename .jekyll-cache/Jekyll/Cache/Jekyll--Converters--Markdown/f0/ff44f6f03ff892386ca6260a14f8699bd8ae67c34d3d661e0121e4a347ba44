I"Ò<p>The 27â€ iMac 5K is unquestionably the best computer Iâ€™ve ever owned. After two months of daily use, for twelve to fourteen hours per day, I can say without reservation that this machine is fantastic. Obviously, Iâ€™m late to the bandwagon on this, better reviews than what I would write <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2014/10/review-27-inch-imac-with-retina-5k-display/">have</a> <a href="https://www.imore.com/retina-5k-imac-review">already</a> <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2842025/mac-computers/review-imac-with-retina-5k-display-is-among-apple-s-brightest-lights.html">been</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/the-27-inch-imac-with-retina-5k-display/">written</a>, and although those reviews are from 2014, they hold up well enough for the 2017 upgrade too. The screen is beautiful, like a massive glossy magazine. The machine is fast enough so I <em>nearly</em> never have to wait. Basically, itâ€™s everything I need from a computer.</p>
