I"²<p>Several more professional sites have written longer and better articles about Appleâ€™s recent event than I can do here. A few of my favorites in no particular order are <a href="1">John Gruberâ€™s take</a>, Ryan Christoffel and Alex Guyot  cover the <a href="2">new iPhones</a> and <a href="3">Apple Watch</a>, respectively, at MacStories, Jason Snellâ€™s take on <a href="4">hits and misses at SixColors</a>,  itâ€™s always worth a click to read everyoneâ€™s pal Jim Dalrymple at The Loopâ€™s <a href="6">thoughts on the event</a>. And of course, the team at iMore has an <a href="5">entire section</a> set aside for the many articles theyâ€™ve already written about whatâ€™s new.</p>
