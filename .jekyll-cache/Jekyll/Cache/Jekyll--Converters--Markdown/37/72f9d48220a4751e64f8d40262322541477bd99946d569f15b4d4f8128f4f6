I"î<p>37 Signals comments on a trend Iâ€™ve been <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/10-27-2008/end-of-an-era-2.html">noticing</a> for a few years. Data centers and IT departments are not the core competency of most businesses, they are a requirement of operating the business. Or, at least, they have been for the past thirty years or so. Businesses are now seeing the benefits of moving what they are not good at, controlling IT, to what they are good at, which is whatever makes them money.</p>
