I"ß<p>I started writing this post talking about how I was using <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html">DEVONthink</a>, and, as often happens when you write things down, I started thinking critically about how I interacted with the application. I took a folder full of screenshots, walked through some usage scenarios, and checked and double-checked what I was actually doing with the application. Then I exported everything to the Finder.</p>
