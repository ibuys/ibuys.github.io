  <p>Montana has the highest suicide rate in the United States. For starters, thereâ€™s the random geographical bad luck that the altitude of the stateâ€™s six most populous cities exceeds 3,000 feet, the elevation at which blood oxygen levels go down and suicide stats go way up. Along with seven Indian reservations and agriculture being a leading industry â€” farmers and natives are more likely to end their own lives than other Americans â€” veterans make up about 10 percent of the stateâ€™s population. According to the new Veterans Affairs secretary, Robert Wilkie, every day, 22 American vets kill themselves.</p>
