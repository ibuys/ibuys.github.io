I"-<p>It’s snowing again, which means my normal 40-minute commute will now be closer to an hour. I’m actually a bit excited by the prospect of a long drive; it will give me some time to catch up on my favorite podcasts, most of which come from <a href="http://5by5.tv">Dan Benjamin at 5by5</a>.</p>
