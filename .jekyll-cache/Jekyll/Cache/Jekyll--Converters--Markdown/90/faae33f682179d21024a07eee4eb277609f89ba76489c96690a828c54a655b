I"ü	<p>A few days ago I decided that I was not going to use anyone elseâ€™s theme on my site. It happened after I stumbled across another site using the exact same theme as mine. Unavoidable really, as long as you are using someone elseâ€™s theme. So, the decision was to either stop using Wordpress, or to design my own theme. I love Wordpress, so I decided to go with the latter.</p>

<p>Designing a web site is a strange mix of code and graphic design. In my case, Iâ€™ve had to go back to php, a language I left a long time ago, and start learning CSS.  Since Iâ€™ve been fooling around in Cocoa for quite a while, going back to php is just <em>painful</em>. Objective-C is a beautiful programming language. Mixing php and htmlâ€¦ well, thatâ€™s just plain ugly. However, that being said, itâ€™s familiar territory, so I almost feel like Iâ€™m coming home. One concept that Iâ€™ve learned with Cocoa is the Modal-View-Controller method, basically separating out the presentation code from the application code (yes, I know there is a lot, lot, lot more to it than thatâ€¦ no Iâ€™m not going to get into it here), using CSS kind of reminds me of the MVC method, in your php/xhtml code you define what objects are going to be displayed, and in CSS you define where and how to display them. I like the separationâ€¦ keeps it clean.</p>

<p>At any rate, Iâ€™ve been busy coming up with the overall look and feel of the site. One thing I believe about software is that simplicity always wins. At least where Iâ€™m concerned it does, thatâ€™s why I use a lot of the apps that I use, because they are simple to use. Think about the Google home page. Simple, and it wins.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d appreciate any comments on the design, and please keep in mind this is only a very early mockup. Also, Iâ€™m going to be using this as my avatar for everywhere that Iâ€™ve got an account online: A <a href="http://www.johnmparks.com/">friend</a> of mine, who actually is a designer, laughed when I told him about the tools Iâ€™ve been using to do the design so far. First, the initial concept was created in <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/OmniGraffle/">OmniGraffle</a>. From OmniGraffle, Iâ€™d export it as a Photoshop file and open it in <a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a> to add the leaves and other touch ups. Right now, thatâ€™s as far as Iâ€™ve got. Iâ€™ll finish the design in the next couple of days, and then move into chopping the file up and getting deep into some code. Hopefully, Iâ€™ll have this finished in two or three weeks.</p>
