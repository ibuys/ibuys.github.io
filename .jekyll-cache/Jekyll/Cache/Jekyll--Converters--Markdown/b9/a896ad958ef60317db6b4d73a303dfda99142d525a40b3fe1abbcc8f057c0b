I"¸<p>After spending a week with <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Linux</a> as my sole computer, I find it very refreshing to come back home to my Mac.  FedEx says my wifeâ€™s PC should be here tomorrow, so she can go back to Word 2007 and I can have Mactimus Prime back.  Itâ€™s not that I didnâ€™t enjoy working with Linux, I did, but Iâ€™ve found that once the geeky pleasure of discovering something new wears off, there are problems.</p>
