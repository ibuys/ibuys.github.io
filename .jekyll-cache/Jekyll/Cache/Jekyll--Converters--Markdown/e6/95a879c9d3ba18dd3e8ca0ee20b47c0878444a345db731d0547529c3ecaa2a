I"y<p>Mozilla has been one of my favorite open source projects since I first learned of them back in 2002. I remember downloading the Mozilla browser, and thinking that it was just like Netscape Navigator (no surprise there), an all-in-one browser that threw in the kitchen sink, just in case you needed it. You can still download itâ€™s descendant, <a href="http://www.seamonkey-project.org/">SeaMonkey</a>. Not long after, I heard about another browser they were calling Phoenix, that, as it was explained to me, pulled out just the web browser from Mozilla, and left everything else alone. I downloaded it, and it was fantastic. Incredibly fast, lean, and simple. It became my favorite right away. There was only one release of Phoenix, after that the browser was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mozilla_Firefox">renamed briefly to Firebird</a>, and finally, Firefox.</p>
