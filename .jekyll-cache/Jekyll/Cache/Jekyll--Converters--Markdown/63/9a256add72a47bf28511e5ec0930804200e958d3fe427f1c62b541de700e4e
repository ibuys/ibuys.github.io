<p>I can’t quite make up my mind on how I feel about “link blogging”. On the one hand, there’s already a lot of people out there who do it better than I can. On the other hand, sometimes I want to share something and make a few pithy comments about it. It’s out of that second feeling that this script is born.</p>

<p>The script started out as an Automator action, but having an Automator wrapper around a single shell script seemed like overkill.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!/bin/bash
	
TITLE=`osascript -e 'tell application "Safari" 
	set pageTitle to (do JavaScript "document.title" in document 1)
end tell'`

URL=`osascript -e 'tell application "Safari" 
	set pageURI to (get URL of document 1)	
end tell'`

TEXT=`osascript -e 'tell application "Safari"
set selectedText to (do JavaScript "(window.getSelection().toString())" in document 1)
end tell'`

QUOTEDTEXT=`echo -n "&gt;"; echo -n $TEXT`

LINK=`echo -n [Jump to Post]; echo -n \($URL\)`

NAME=`echo $TITLE | sed s/\ /-/g`
USERNAME=`whoami`
POSTNAME=`date "+%Y-%m-%d"-$NAME`	
echo $POSTNAME
POST_FQN=~/Public/Site/_posts/$POSTNAME.markdown

POST_DATE=`date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`

echo "---" &gt;&gt;$POST_FQN
echo "layout: post" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "title: $TITLE" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "date: $POST_DATE" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "---" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN

echo "$LINK" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "$QUOTEDTEXT" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN

echo $POST_FQN

/usr/bin/open $POST_FQN
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That first line is pretty ugly. I don’t recall when I wrote this, but it’s been working reliably for long enough that I don’t feel the need to change it just yet. Then again, a shell script that calls AppleScript that calls JavaScript seems pretty ridiculous.</p>

<p>This script looks at the current web page in Safari and grabs the title, URL, and any selected text and builds a new post in the format my site builder script expects. Similar to my previous New Post script, this one opens the new file in MacVim, ready for writing.</p>

<p>I call the script from Quicksilver using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Run…</code> command, and tied the command to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^⎇ ⌘ P</code> for a hotkey.</p>

<p>I might start putting more links on the site. There are often things that I find might be interesting to a certain segment of the Mac community, mainly the more technical and scientific groups, that I haven’t done anything significant with. I’d like to change that.</p>
