I"™<p>What does it mean when an <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5156903/how-to-hackintosh-a-dell-mini-9-into-the-ultimate-os-x-netbook">entire</a> <a href="http://uneasysilence.com/archive/2008/10/13519/">community</a> <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Apple/?p=3258">springs</a> up around hacking together a product that is not otherwise available? Apple has been <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/04/23/apple-says-no-to-netbook-quietly-nods-yes-to-tablet/">adamant</a> that it is not interested in the netbook market, but according to the many users who are breaking Appleâ€™s EULA and installing OS X on Dell Minis, the market is there, and waiting.</p>

<p>Rumors have been circulating for <a href="http://theappleblog.com/tag/netbook/">some time now</a> that Apple is working on a netbook.  I wish I had some special insight or access to Appleâ€™s inner-workings so I could confirm or deny those rumors, but all I can say is <em>I hope so</em>. To get everyone on the same page here, let me explain exactly what I mean when I say an Apple netbook. Iâ€™m talking about a small device with a ten inch (or smaller) screen, small physical keyboard, reduced hardware specs, running a legal, full copy of OS X. Iâ€™m not talking about an iPhone, or some kind of iPhone/MacBook hybrid. While its not clear if Apple would consider such a device or not, what is clear is that people would buy a $500 MacBook Nano (or NetMac?) in droves.</p>
