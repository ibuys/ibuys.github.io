I"Æ<p>Marco struck a nerve with his <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-ground">latest post</a> lamenting the declining quality of Apple software. The post was picked up by â€œanalystsâ€ and debated on television by a panel of â€œexpertsâ€. While I understand the frustrations of those affected by more serious bugs than Iâ€™ve seen, I canâ€™t help but wonder if they really understand what the alternatives are like.</p>
