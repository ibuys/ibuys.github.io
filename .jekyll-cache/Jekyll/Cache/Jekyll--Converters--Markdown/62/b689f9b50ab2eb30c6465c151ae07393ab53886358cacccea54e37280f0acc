I"J<p>Word leaked out yesterday that Yahoo has it’s popular Delicious bookmarking service <a href="http://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/15483488237002752">on the chopping block</a>.  I don’t personally have an account, not anymore, so the closing won’t affect me. Twitter tells a different story, my stream lit up with people upset about the decision.  Yahoo’s leak, coupled with their announcement that the company is <a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20101215/heres-carol-bartzs-internal-layoff-memo-to-beleaguered-yahoo-troops/">laying off 4% of it’s workforce</a> right before Christmas, caused a fairly good sized migration from Delicious to <a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a>.  I do have a Pinboard account, and I think I even have a few bookmarks saved, but its been weeks since the last time I visited the site.</p>
