I"{<p>For some reason today when I opened up MacVim and hit ,t to navigate to a file, MacVim crashed. The terminal spat out an ugly, and unhelpful error about “deadly signal SEGV”, but knowing that I just invoked the Command-T plugin, the error was easy to track down. Command-T is not like other plugins that I have installed with Pathogen, it lives on its own and is not updated as a Git submodule.</p>

<p>To fix the error, all I needed to do is download the latest version of Command-T as a “.vba” file and run through the install again. The install procedure is <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025">fairly simple</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To install open the vimball archive in Vim:</p>

  <p>vim command-t.vba</p>

  <p>Then source it:</p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:so %</code></p>

  <p>The C extension must also be then compiled; for instance, if Vimball installs your plugin files in ~/.vim, then you would do this:</p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/.vim/ruby/command-t 
ruby extconf.rb 
make </code></pre></figure>

<p>And now everything is back to normal. Command-T is a great plugin, I recommend it. My latest adventures in Vim are available on <a href="https://github.com/jbuys/MyVim">Github</a>, if you’d like to follow along.</p>
