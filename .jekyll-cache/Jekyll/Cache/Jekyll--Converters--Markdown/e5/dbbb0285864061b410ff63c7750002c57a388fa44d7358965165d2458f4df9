I"ù<p>I like to think about the future. Iâ€™m an optimist, so in my mind, the future looks pretty great, more â€œMeet the Robinsonsâ€ and less â€œBladerunnerâ€.</p>

<p>While Apple is busy making â€œmemojisâ€ and other ridiculous features no one asked for, Samsung released a phone that actually looks like what I want. It just doesnâ€™t run iOS. This is the first time I recall seriously being drawn to an Android device as my next phone. The Samsung Galaxy Note9 looks like the embodiment of what Iâ€™ve been expecting computers to become for several years now, Iâ€™ve just been waiting for the hardware to be powerful enough to do what I want it to do.</p>

  <p>Samsung DeX gives you what you want from a PC experience: a big screen, a full-size keyboard and a mouse. 
Just connect your phone into an external display to use apps, review documents, and watch videos on a PC-like interface.</p>
