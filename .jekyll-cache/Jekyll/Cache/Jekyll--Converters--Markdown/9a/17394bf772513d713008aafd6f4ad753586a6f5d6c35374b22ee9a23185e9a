I"ç<p>A friend of mine is having a heck of a time with his new MacBook. Heâ€™s a recent convert to Macs, and as a philosophy student he spends a <em>lot</em> of time in Word. When he first bought his shiny new MacBook, he was surprised to find out there was no word processor in it. I pointed out TextEdit, which he quickly dismissed as not nearly powerful enough for what he needed to do. So, back to the store he went to pick up a copy of iWork â€˜08, and started working with Pages.</p>
