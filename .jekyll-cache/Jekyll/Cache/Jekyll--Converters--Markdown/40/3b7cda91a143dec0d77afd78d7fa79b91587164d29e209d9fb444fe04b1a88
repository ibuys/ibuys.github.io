I"›<p>Iâ€™ve been using, and subscribing to, <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a>, <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com">Bear</a>, and <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> for a while now. It seems a bit silly, especially since they all do basically the same thing. On the surface they are all writing apps, but once I start to think a little deeper about them I can see where the differences lay.</p>
