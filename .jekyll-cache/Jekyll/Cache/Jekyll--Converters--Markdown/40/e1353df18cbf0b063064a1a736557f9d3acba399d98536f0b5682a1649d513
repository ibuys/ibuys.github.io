<p>Just for kicks, donâ€™t miss Marco Armentâ€™s <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/07/25/siracusa-mountain-lion-review-review">Review of John Siracusaâ€™s Review of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion</a>, as well as John Siracusa <a href="http://siracusa.tumblr.com/post/27978338524/about-my-mountain-lion-review">writing about writing</a> his Mountain Lion reveiw.</p>

<p>As for me, this is the first major upgrade of OS X that I do not see a compelling reason to upgrade right away. I plan to give it a day or two first.</p>
