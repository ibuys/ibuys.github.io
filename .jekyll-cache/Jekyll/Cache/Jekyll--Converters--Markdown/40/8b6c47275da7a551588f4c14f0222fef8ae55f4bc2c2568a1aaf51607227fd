I" <p>There is no one application or system that is right for managing all of your information. If there were, we wouldnâ€™t need apps like Contacts or Calendar, those things would just be merged into the Finder, or whatever mythical computing system I found myself wishing for the past couple of weeks. This is a <em>good thing</em>, even if not having a single view into all my data drives me a bit nuts sometimes. Specialization allows applications to provide a better experience for the specific type of data they were designed to handle.</p>
