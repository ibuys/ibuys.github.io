I"´<p>MacVim, again. Iâ€™ve tried to make BBEdit work for me, but thereâ€™s just so much that I wind up wishing for that I donâ€™t have BBEdit configured to do, or that thereâ€™s just that <em>little</em> extra bit of friction. The last straw was when BBEdit decided it didnâ€™t need to soft-wrap the lines of Markdown files. I know that itâ€™s probably my fault somehow, but Iâ€™m just tired of making excuses for the app in my head.</p>
