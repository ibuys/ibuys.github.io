<p>Turn it all off.</p>

<p>I’ve deleted the twitter apps from my phone and computer, I don’t log into Facebook anymore, and I’m limiting when I read news outside of the tech news to once a week. It just became too much, I started feeling angry all the time, and reading more news wasn’t making me feel any better about it. There was nothing I could do about how I felt, there were no actions I could take to assuage the pain. The constant flow of new events across the world to be outraged about is too much for anyone to handle.</p>

<p>So, I’ve started myself on a strict information diet. Unless the news is related to Apple or the tech industry, or any of my hobbies,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I’m leaving it till Saturday morning after I’ve gone on a long run.</p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence that binging on news is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/19/violent-media-anxiety_n_6671732.html">detrimental to your health</a>. In the past few months I’ve noticed my mental state has grown significantly more pessimistic about the state of the world, when in truth my personal circumstances have never been better.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>That’s not to say that the issues in the world right now are not serious, or that I don’t care about the many, many problems affecting our society. I do. I care enormously. I simply can’t let how much I care dictate how I feel about everything else. I’m not cutting myself off completely, I’m simply making a decision for myself about when and how much of the news I’ll allow in. When the time comes for action, I’ll take it.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> I just don’t need to be reminded about what I already know over, and over, and over.</p>

<p>Sometimes the best thing to do for your own mental health is to log off.</p>
