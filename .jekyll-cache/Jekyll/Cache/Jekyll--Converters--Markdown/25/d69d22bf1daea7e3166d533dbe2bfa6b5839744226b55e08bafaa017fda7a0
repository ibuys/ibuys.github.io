My MacBook at work sits on my desk all day and all night. When I sit down to work on it, I expect it to be ready for me, and ready to ask how high when I tell it to jump. I get a bit annoyed if I come back after a few minutes or an hour and find that the Mac has gone to sleep while Iâ€™ve been gone. So, I spent a few minutes in the Energy Saver preference pane to configure the machine to my schedule.</p>
