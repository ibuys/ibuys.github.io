  <p>Iâ€™ve been working the last few months on an update to the OmniFocus Video Field Guide. Iâ€™ve updated it for several new features and gone deep on the iOS Automation and URL linking. Iâ€™m making final edits and additions over the next few days and intend to publish it sometime Sunday (probably late).</p>

<p>OmniFocus is where my stress goes to die. Itâ€™s where I regain control of my life. My system for making sure that things that need done arenâ€™t forgotten. Bills are paid, calls are made, and projects move forward. Itâ€™s also where ideas go for evaluation. If I have an idea for a new project Iâ€™ll drop it in OmniFocus and let it sit there for a while. I might file it away in itâ€™s own project folder, put a â€œDefer Untilâ€ date on it for the weekend, and let the idea sit and stew for a bit.</p>

<p>If the idea has merit, if I keep coming back to it and deferring it more than once or twice, then I focus more on it and start to eck out next actions to start making it a reality. I know there are a lot of task management apps out there, and even a few analog systems like the Bullet Journal, but Iâ€™m so invested, and so used to how OmniFocus works that I have zero motivation to move to anything else. By this point, OmniFocus works the way my brain works, it is my trusted system.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s all thanks to David Sparkâ€™s OmniFocus guides. I adopted his system years ago, modified it slightly and made it my own. Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing where heâ€™s taking the guides next.</p>
