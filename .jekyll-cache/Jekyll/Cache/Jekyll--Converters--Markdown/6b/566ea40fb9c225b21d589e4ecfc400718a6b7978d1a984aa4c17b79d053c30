I"¦<p>Iâ€™ve been using different forms of computer â€œchatâ€ for over ten years now, starting with operator-to-operator communications over a 9600baud satcom circuit in the Navy.  Over time, Iâ€™ve become used to using certain forms of â€œemoticonsâ€ to convey subtle nuances in the conversation that are unnecessary in face to face communications. I even have friends with whom I communicate with entirely over chat.</p>
