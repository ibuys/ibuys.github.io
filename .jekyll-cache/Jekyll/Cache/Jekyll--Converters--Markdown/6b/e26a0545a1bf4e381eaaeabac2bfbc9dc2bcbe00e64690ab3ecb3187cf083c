I"[<p>So, I won <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWrimo</a>, and wrote a “novel”. Although, it’s not <em>really</em> a novel, more like a novella, and it’s not <em>really</em> written just yet, it’s 50,000 words that somewhat make up a complete story, but with more plot holes than you can shake a stick at. Couple that with the number of inconsistencies in the world building, flat characters, characters who’s names I forget half way through the writing, and two chapters that I decided I was going to throw away completely, and you’ve got what is colloquially known as a first draft.</p>
