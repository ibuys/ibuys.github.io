I"Ü<p>I have one wish for the next major iOS release: full keyboard support. The iPad works with the bluetooth keyboard, and the original iPad came with a keyboard dock, but support for doing things other than basic text is sparse at best. My wish list is small, but meaningful. I would like to see support for <strong>all</strong> the keys on the keyboard, the ability to command-tab between running applications, and arrow key navigation for apps that include table views.</p>
