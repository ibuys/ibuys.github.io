I"Ä<p>I got an email from my mom the other day asking me for a recommendation on a new Mac. The first question I asked was what her budget was like. She said sheâ€™d like to keep it under a grand, which right away narrowed the field quite a bit. Next I asked what she would be using the machine for, to which she replied with the standard home use cases of â€œincome taxes, email, scanning, internet, etcâ€, as well as printing to a Brother ink jet.</p>
