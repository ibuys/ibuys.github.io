  <p>My ★★★★★ action-thriller novel, CHANGER, is now available as a beautiful, 474-page paperback!</p>

<p>I’ve been following Matt for years, I even used some of his code in <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/Paragraphs">Paragraphs.</a> I was interested, if a bit reserved, when he said he was leaving programming to be a writer, but here we have the result of his work.</p>

<p>I ordered an autographed copy. Least I could do for enjoying both his writing and his code for so long.</p>
