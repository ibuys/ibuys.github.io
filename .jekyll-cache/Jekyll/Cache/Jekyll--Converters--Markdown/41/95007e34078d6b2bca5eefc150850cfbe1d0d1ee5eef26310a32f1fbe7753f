I"3<p>A long, long time ago, what seems like a different life now, I was a Sailor.
Towards the end of my teenage years, I came to a point where I knew I had to
do something with my life, and at the time, that something was not college. My
adoptive father was in the Navy, so I decided to follow in his footsteps and
joined the Navy myself in October of 1995. From June of 1996 to July of 1999 I
was assigned to the USS Platte, an oiler. During this time I made the best
friends of my life, met my wife, and travelled across Europe and even into the
Middle East.</p>
