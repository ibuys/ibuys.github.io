I"Þ<p>I just spent the past 10 minutes trying to get this article I wrote for BrightHub posted using their online writers application.  Iâ€™m not sure what language they are using, or what platform the site is running on, but I tried Chrome, Firefox, and finally, out of desperation, Internet Explorer 7, all with the same results.  Almost every time I would try to preview the article before submitting it, the application would wipe out everything I just typed.  Everything.</p>
