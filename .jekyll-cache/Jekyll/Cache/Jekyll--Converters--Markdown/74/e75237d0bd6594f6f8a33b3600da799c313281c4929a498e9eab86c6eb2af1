I"ô<p>Iâ€™m a fan of the three-pronged approach to backups. Iâ€™ve got two different drives attached to my iMac, one for Time Machine for hourly backups, and the other for SuperDuper! for nightly clones of the internal drive. For many years Iâ€™ve also had BackBlaze running for a third off-site backup in case the house goes up in flames. At $6 per month it wasnâ€™t bad, but at the beginning of the year when I did a review of subscriptions and decided what should stay, it didnâ€™t make the cut. Not having an off-site backup bothered me though, and I considered starting it back up again till I heard <a href="https://atp.fm/episodes/368">the guys on ATP</a> talking about <a href="https://www.arqbackup.com">Arq</a> and thought Iâ€™d give it a shot.</p>
