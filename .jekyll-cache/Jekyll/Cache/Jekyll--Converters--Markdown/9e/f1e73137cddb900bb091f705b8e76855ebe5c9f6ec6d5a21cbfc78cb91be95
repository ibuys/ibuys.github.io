I"£<p>My wife and I were sitting at the dinner table chatting, winding down for the night, when I saw a pair of headlights shining in our back window. The back side of our house faces the middle school parking lot, with a good amount of lawn and trees between the edge of my land and the beginning of the gravel, so it is not <em>too</em> unusual to see cars back there, but late on a Saturday night did seem strange.</p>
