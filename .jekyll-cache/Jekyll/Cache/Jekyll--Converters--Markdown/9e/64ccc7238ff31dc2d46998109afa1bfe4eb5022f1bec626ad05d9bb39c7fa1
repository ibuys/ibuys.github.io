I remember, years ago, asking some of the same questions of an older Unix guru, and asking why I should bother learning such an eccentric and â€œoutdatedâ€ text editor. His answer has stuck with me, he said â€œBecause it is the only text editor guaranteed to be on every server, and some day you will need it, and have no other alternatives.â€ Vim, short for â€œvi improvedâ€ is ubiquitous, but it is also so much more, and the time you spend learning it will be repaid to you tenfold in productivity.</p>
