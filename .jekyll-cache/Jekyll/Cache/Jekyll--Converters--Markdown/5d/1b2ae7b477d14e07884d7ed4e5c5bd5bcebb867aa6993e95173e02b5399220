I"§<p>Via a post I saw today from <a href="http://chrisbowler.com/journal/wrong-dictionary">Chris Bowler</a>, via a newsletter by <a href="https://www.sarahjbray.com">Sarah Bray</a>, discussing an article written by <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary">James Somers</a>, wherein he describes the writing process of <a href="http://jsomers.net/mcphee-draft-no-4.pdf">John McPhee</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, and how he uses a good dictionary to go from last draft to finished work. The emphasis here is on a <em>good</em> dictionary, namely the 1913 Websterâ€™s Unabridged. I wonâ€™t attempt to describe how wonderful the dictionary is here, James did a fantastic job of that on his <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary">blog five years ago</a>. I will however say that I think his installation instructions for getting the dictionary usable on your Mac are out of date. Hereâ€™s the easy way to do it.</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Good grief!Â <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
