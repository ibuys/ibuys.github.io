  <p>macOS Sierra 10.12.1, released yesterday, includes hidden Apple Pay images that depict the brand new MacBook Pro with an OLED touch panel that‚Äôs set to be announced by Apple on Thursday, October 27.</p>

<p>The ‚Äúmagic toolbar‚Äù looks like it will replace the function keys, along with the escape key necessary for using Vim. I‚Äôve seen questions asking what Vim users are going to do. For a moment I started to worry myself, although I‚Äôm not using MacVim on my Mac anymore, I still need to use it regularly on servers, and on servers I‚Äôll have no <code class="highlighter-rouge">.vimrc</code> customizations for remapping keys.</p>

<p>However, since the point of the touchscreen is to be able to dynamically assign keys as needed, I bet when the Terminal is open, the escape key will be right where it needs to be.</p>
