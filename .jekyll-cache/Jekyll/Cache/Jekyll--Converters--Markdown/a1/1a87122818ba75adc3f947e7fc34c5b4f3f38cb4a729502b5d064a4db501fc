I"Ë<p>The hard thing about keeping a job in the technology field is that it is constantly changing.  Just this past summer $WORK fired several mainframe workers who could not keep up.  They got stuck on one technology that they knew how to operate, and failed to evolve when the field did.  Now I think its clear that another sector of the job market is on its way out, the one that I, and thousands of others occupy, the job title of systems administrator.</p>
