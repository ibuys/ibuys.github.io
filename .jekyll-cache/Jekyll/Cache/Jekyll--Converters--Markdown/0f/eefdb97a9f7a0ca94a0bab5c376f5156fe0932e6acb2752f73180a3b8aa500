I"<<p>At the beginning of Spring, I signed up for two races, the half-marathon <a href="http://damtodam.com">Dam to Dam</a> in the summer, and the full Des Moines Marathon in October. This was my second half, but Iâ€™d never come close to a full marathon, so signing up for it was aspirational motivation. I was training with a group running long on Saturday mornings, so as the time for the half approached and I started thinking about the full, I was feeling more and more confident that I would actually be able to run it. Then I ran the half, and things went wrong.</p>
