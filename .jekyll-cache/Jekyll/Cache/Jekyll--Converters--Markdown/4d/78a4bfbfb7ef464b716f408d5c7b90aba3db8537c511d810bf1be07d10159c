I"<p>I still need an <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2009/09/yojimbo-and-anything-buckets/">anything bucket</a>, and nothing fills that gap like my old friend Yojimbo. I was an early adopter of Yojimbo, back with version one, and I upgraded faithfully for version 2 and version 3, but I held off for a long time on version 4. In the mean time I tried Evernote, DEVONthink, Pinboard, and just the file system to fill the void that Yojimbo filled so gracefully. No more, Iâ€™ve come home, and it feels great to be here.</p>
