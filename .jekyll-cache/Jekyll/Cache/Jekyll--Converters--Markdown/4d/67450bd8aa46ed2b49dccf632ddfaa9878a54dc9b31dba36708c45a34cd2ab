<blockquote>
  <p>2) Effective immediately, Sailors in paygrades E1-E3 will be addressed as “Seaman,” E4-E6 will be called “Petty Officer Third/Second/First Class” as appropriate, and Senior enlisted in paygrades E7-E9 will be “Chief,” “Senior Chief,” or “Master Chief” depending on their paygrade.
•   For example, a Sailor will no longer be called YN2. Instead, they will be called a “Second Class Petty Officer” or “Petty Officer.”
•   There will no longer be a distinction between “Airman, Fireman and Seaman.” They will all be “Seaman.”
•   This cultural change will not happen overnight. It will take a measured approach to make it the norm.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t you know it, as soon as I post something about <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/Studying_in_the_Pit">my time in the Navy</a>, they up and change how it works. Ridiculous idea to get rid of the rates. Learning another sailor’s rate and rating let you know immediately what their specialty was, and how much you might have in common with them.</p>

<p>I worked hard to be IT1, glad I’m not active duty to see this.</p>
