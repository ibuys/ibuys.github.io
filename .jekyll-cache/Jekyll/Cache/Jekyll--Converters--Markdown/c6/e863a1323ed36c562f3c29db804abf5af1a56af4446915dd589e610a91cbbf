I"Á<p>Iâ€™ve noticed a tendency in my Mac setup to veer towards higher levels of complexity. In truth, Iâ€™d rather not use anything outside of the Apple provided ecosystem, but for one reason or another Iâ€™m constantly drawn to other apps and command line tools. It is a struggle to find balance between applications that actually enhance my productivity, and distractions that pull me away from the task Iâ€™m attempting to use my computer for.</p>
