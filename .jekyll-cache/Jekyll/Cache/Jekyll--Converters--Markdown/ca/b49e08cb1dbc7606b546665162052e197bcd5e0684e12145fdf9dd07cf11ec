I"<p>If you really, <em>really</em> care about Markdown, Jeff Atwood of Coding Horror and Stack Exchange fame has a <a href="http://standardmarkdown.com">new project for you</a>. Apparently, Jeff didn’t think <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/08/markdown_10">Markdown’s original creator’s</a> care of the code was quite up to snuff, and decided to build a new project to more accurately codify the syntax and implementation details. All good things, if, again, you <em>really</em> care about such details. If, however, you are using Markdown like the majority of us: to making writing on the web a bit easier, well, this all might go by unnoticed. At least, it probably would have if Jeff had named his project anything other than “<strong>Standard Markdown</strong>”.</p>
