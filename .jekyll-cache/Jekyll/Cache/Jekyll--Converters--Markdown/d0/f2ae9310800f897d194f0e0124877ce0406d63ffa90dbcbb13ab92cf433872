I"<p>Another keynote came and went yesterday, and there was nothing I could do after it was over. I couldnâ€™t order the new iPhone 7, or upgrade my current iPhone to iOS 10. I couldnâ€™t buy the new Apple Watch, and even the new iWork collaborative editing features are in new versions â€œ<a href="http://www.apple.com/numbers/">coming soon</a>â€. When I tried to download the new Mario game, the App Store let me know Iâ€™d be notified when it was available. After everything was announced yesterday, today Iâ€™m wondering what the point of having the event when they did was.</p>

<p>There was once a time when you could download new apps or operating systems as soon as the keynote was over. I specifically remember Steve saying more than once â€œâ€¦ and itâ€™s available <em>today</em>â€. For the past few years we havenâ€™t been getting that. At best the new features are coming in a couple of weeks, or at worst at some undefined time, presumably so far in the future that they canâ€™t nail down a specific date.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s good to ship products when they are ready and not at an arbitrary keynote date, but Apple used to be better at coordinating those times to all coincide. By not having anything available on day one, Apple misses out on the consumer excitement it generates by having these events in the first place. At least, Iâ€™m not as excited today as I was yesterday. After they keynote was over if I had the ability to order a new Series Two Apple Watch, I almost certainly would have. After giving it a day to think it over, now Iâ€™m not as convinced that I need one. Iâ€™ll probably wait for the first few reviews to come in and see how much of an upgrade it is.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is another sign of Appleâ€™s confidence and maturity as a massive global corporation. Itâ€™s possible that the internal workings of scheduling all the moving parts is impossible to line up correctly. It used to be we only had the one platform and one operating system, the Mac and OS X.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Now we have the Mac, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and Apple TV; macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS, as well as iCloud to tie everything together, and the multiple services  Apple provides. Now add the complexities of global shipping and coordinating their retail stores around the world, and I can start to make out why it might not all line up the same as it used to.</p>

<p>However, it doesnâ€™t change the fact that the event came and went, and after it was over there was nothing I could do but read about whatâ€™s coming.</p>

<p><strong>iPhone 7</strong></p>

<p>I upgrade every two years on the â€œSâ€ cycle, so on the off years, like this one, I get a glimpse of whatâ€™s coming when I do decide to upgrade. Overall the new iPhone seems like a great upgrade. I think theyâ€™ve taken appropriate steps to mitigate the uproar over removing the headphone jack by both including an adapter and setting a reasonable price for replacements. Iâ€™ve got at least another year with my current iPhone 6S, so by the time Iâ€™m ready to upgrade the story wonâ€™t be a story anymore.</p>

<p>More concerning is removing the physical home button and replacing it with a 3D Touch area. This is one of those things that I really hope works well, but since I havenâ€™t been impressed with 3D Touch on the 6S, Iâ€™m skeptical of how well itâ€™ll work for the most-used button on the phone. How fast will it respond to double-clicking for the app switcher? The exiting 3D Touch app switcher, where you press on the side of the phone is terrible, I never know if Iâ€™m about to damage my phone or what amount of pressure to apply. I find it unreliable enough that I donâ€™t use it. Again, hopefully by the 7S model this will be resolved. Better camera, better color, faster CPU, all good things.</p>

<p><strong>AirPods</strong></p>

<p>I already lost them in the couch. Then another pair went through the wash. Iâ€™ll probably not be getting these.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Watch Series 2</strong></p>

<p>I wear a fitbit most days, but I run with my phone strapped to my arm, tracking my runs with the Nike+ Run Club app. When the Apple Watch was first announced being able to run without my phone was the first thing that came to mind, but the hardware wasnâ€™t ready yet. The Watch didnâ€™t have the ability to accurately track distance without GPS, so it still needed to be paired with the phone, which defeated the purpose for what I wanted it for. Now that GPS has finally been added Iâ€™m seriously thinking about getting one to replace my fitbit as a personal fitness coach and tracker, but Iâ€™m going to want to hear how it works for a few other people first.</p>

<p>That the watch is waterproof now is nice, but not a big deal for me. Sometimes I run in the rain, and not having to worry about my phone getting wet would be nice, but I havenâ€™t swam for a few years. I suppose if I ever start training for a triathlon itâ€™ll come in handy.</p>

<p>I use Nikeâ€™s apps, and have for about 1640 miles, but that Nike-branded Apple Watch was just plain ugly. No way Iâ€™m putting down any money for that band. The pure white Nike band looks acceptable, but still not as nice as the black sport band.</p>

<p><strong>Assorted Nuts</strong></p>

<p>The enhancements to iWork would have been more interesting to me a few years ago when I was in grad school. I had to write a few collaborative papers, and the only way to do it at the time was Google Docs, but I would have much rather worked in Pages. Of course, I still probably would have had to use Google Docs because the other students I worked with werenâ€™t on Macs.</p>

<p>The Mario game looks like fun, Iâ€™ll buy it when it comes out, but what Iâ€™m really looking forward to is a proper Zelda adventure. Weâ€™ll see how far Nintendoâ€™s commitment to iOS goes.</p>

<p>I could have done without Tim Cook singing, but the skit was fine. Better than previous attempts have been.</p>

<p>I quipped on Twitter that Phil Schiller reminded me of the Cowardly Lion from the Wizard of Oz when he started talking about <em>courage</em>. It does take some amount of courage to â€œpush the human race forwardâ€, and if Apple has to do it one port at a time, then Iâ€™m on board for the ride. I just think they could have found a better way to come across, a better way to convey their reasoning and the purpose behind the change. Iâ€™m not going to miss the port, as long as Iâ€™ve got headphones Iâ€™m fine, but I use either a bluetooth speaker or the built in speakers more often than the headphones, especially now that Iâ€™m not driving to work every day and listening to podcasts in the car.</p>

<p>Yesterdayâ€™s announcements were about what was expected, Mario being the notable exception. There was not a lot for me, personally, to get excited about. Iâ€™m in the market for a new Mac, so Iâ€™m hoping for a refresh next month. Then maybe Iâ€™ll get excited.</p>
