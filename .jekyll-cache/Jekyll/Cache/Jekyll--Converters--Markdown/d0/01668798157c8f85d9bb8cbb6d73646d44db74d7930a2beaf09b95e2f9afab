I"°<p>My commute takes me past the <em>sanitary landfill</em> every morning, a daily reminder to be careful about what I throw away, and what I can recycle. Driving by the dump doesnâ€™t bother me per se, but the maniacs who drive the dump trucks do. Iâ€™ve learned to watch the turn into the dump, watching for the massive metal beasts, trying to anticipate when theyâ€™ll pull out, and if Iâ€™ll have to swerve out of their way.</p>
