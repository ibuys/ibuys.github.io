I"<<p>Part of a Farmdog project I’m working on needs nice syntax highlighting for markdown. After searching around for a bit I found Ali Rantakari’s <a href="http://hasseg.org/peg-markdown-highlight/">PEG Markdown Highlight</a> project, and knew that it would be a perfect fit. Unfortunately, the code was not written for <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html">ARC</a>, or Automatic Reference Counting, and my project was. Rantakari’s code worked fantastic outside of ARC, but inside it needed a few days worth of love and attention.</p>
