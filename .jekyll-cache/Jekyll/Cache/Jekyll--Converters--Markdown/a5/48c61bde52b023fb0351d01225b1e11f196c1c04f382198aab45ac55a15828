I"<p>Last summer I decided to dive into programming and give it everything I’ve got.  For months, I would get up at 5 and pour through the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321503619/bignerdranch-20">Hillgass</a> book, every page, every challenge.  I’d revisit it at night, after the kids were in bed, and code till I couldn’t stay awake any more.  I finished the book, and started coding my first real application.  It was then that I found out how very little reading one book gave you.  Hillegass says he gives you 80%, I’m thinking it’s more like 50%, tops.  I reached out to the Cocoa Dev mailing list for help, and eventually even went to a CocoaHeads meeting with the local chapter.  Meeting some “real” developers, I despaired.  There was far, far too much that I didn’t know, I felt that it would take me an entire lifetime to learn what I needed to know.  I gave up, wrote <a href="http://ibuys.github.com/2008/12/goodbye-cocoa.html">Goodbye Cocoa</a>, and focused on something else.</p>
