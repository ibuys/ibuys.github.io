<blockquote>
  <p>Whoâ€™s anyone? Which teacher has time to make custom books for his or her class? One of the things Iâ€™ve become concerned about is the number of items we tend to keep adding to a teacherâ€™s plate. They have to manage a classroom of 15â€“30 kids, understand all of the material they teach, learn all of the systems their school uses, handle discipline issues, grade papers, and help students learn.</p>

  <p>When do we start to take things off of a teacherâ€™s plates? When do we give them more hours in the day? Whatever Apple envisioned in 2012, itâ€™s clear that did not play out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chambers works in education, and has been paying close attention to the market for years. He knows what heâ€™s talking about, and his main point is that Apple hasnâ€™t made a good enough value proposition for schools to wean them away from Google.</p>

<p>The optimist in me would like to think that Appleâ€™s system would work, but people who actually work in the field are saying otherwise.</p>
