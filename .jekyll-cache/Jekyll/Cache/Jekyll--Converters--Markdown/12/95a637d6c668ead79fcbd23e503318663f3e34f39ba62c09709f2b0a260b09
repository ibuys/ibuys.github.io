I"è<p>The tech world is once again loosing their grip after Apple has gone, as they see it, too far, too fast with the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook/">MacBook</a>. They can think of a thousand reasons why the Macâ€™s single USB-C port is a deal-breaker for any sane person. The single port is too restrictive. What if I want to hook up a USB mouse while Iâ€™m charging? Why isnâ€™t there a removable battery? Why canâ€™t I expand the storage? Less space than a Nomad. Lame.</p>
