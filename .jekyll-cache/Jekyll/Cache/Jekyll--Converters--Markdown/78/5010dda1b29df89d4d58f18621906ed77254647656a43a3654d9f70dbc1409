  <p>‚ÄúWe are all stories in the end, just make it a good one eh?‚Äù</p>

<p>Christians, shaman, poets, and authors all know one thing‚Ä¶ what we believe shapes who we are, and the stories we tell ourselves shape those beliefs. Our lives are a self-fulfilling prophecy. We become who we believe we will become, because we take actions that are logically attuned to the story we‚Äôve told ourselves about our life. Storytellers hold power, not because of wealth or authority, but because the stories they tell shape our understanding of the world around us. In turn, how we understand the world and our place in it guides our decisions and shapes our world to be more like what we believe it to be.</p>
