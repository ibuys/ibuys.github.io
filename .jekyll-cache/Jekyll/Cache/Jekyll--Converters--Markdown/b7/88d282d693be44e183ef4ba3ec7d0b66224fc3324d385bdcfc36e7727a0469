I"Å<p>Iâ€™ve been experimenting with the design of this site for the past couple weeks. First, I used a default Jekyll template, slightly modified to my liking. Next, I tried out a very nice theme that made good use of hero images and included nice typography. I changed the name of the site to â€œINTERACTâ€, and briefly considered leaving it at that. Unfortunately, the more I looked at the site the more it looked like it belonged to someone else.</p>
