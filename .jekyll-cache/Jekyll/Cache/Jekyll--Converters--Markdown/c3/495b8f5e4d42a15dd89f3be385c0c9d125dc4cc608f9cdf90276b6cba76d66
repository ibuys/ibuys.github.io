<p>So, while I was debugging the first post using Scout, I found an oddity in NSString. I was building the links between the posts using <code class="highlighter-rouge">stringByAppendingPathComponent</code>, to join the site‚Äôs base URL with the path component of the individual post.  Unfortunately, that method seems to be stripping one of the forward slashes off of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://</code> string, which screws up building links.</p>

<p>To test it, I created a blank Xcode project, and added this method to the App Delegate:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>-(void)awakeFromNib
{
NSString *first = @"http://first";
NSString *second = @"second/part.html";
NSLog(@"first + second = %@", [first stringByAppendingPathComponent:second]);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And, sure enough, here is the output from that method:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2013-01-03 19:26:02.388 NSStringTester[39861:303] first + second = http:/first/second/part.html
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A quick search through Scout‚Äôs source files shows that I‚Äôm using <code class="highlighter-rouge">stringByAppendingPathComponent</code> 53 times. Looks like I‚Äôve got some work to do.</p>

<p>Also, this is a good time to point out that when you are doing web development, it is very important to test with multiple browsers. Safari hid the problem, Firefox did not.</p>

<p>Finally, it turns out that this is not actually a bug in NSString, but a bug in my understanding of this method.  My thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyohe/status/287009148665733120">Matt Yohe</a> who was kind enough to point out my mistake on Twitter.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm still considering filing this as a bug, but I can see where they are coming from. Double slashes would not work for a file URL, but if they are already parsing the string for something like that, why not just check for ‚Äúhttp‚Äù as well?</p>
