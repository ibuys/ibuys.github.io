I"¸	<p>My personal browser of choice has almost always been <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">Omniweb</a>. Omniweb and I went through a tough time for a while when it (she?) was crashing frequently and generally having a tough time of it. The Omni Group has once again straightened things out, and she (yea, Iâ€™ve decided Omniweb is a she) is once again fast, sleek, and powerful. There is one small item about the browser that bothers me though, and that is the lack of a search function from the browsers contextual menu that pops up when you select a word and right click on it.</p>

<p>Exhibit A: Omniweb Contextual Menu

<p>Omniweb has some interesting options available, including the somewhat dubious value of cascading the â€œPageâ€ menu that is available when right clicking without selecting a word. Iâ€™ve tried both the â€œStart Speakingâ€ and â€œInspect Elementâ€ options, neither of which do me any good in my normal browsing flow.</p>

<p>When Omniweb and I were not getting along I tried out both Firefox and Safari for a while. While both browsers offer a search function from the contextual menu, Firefox has made the best choice from a usability standpoint.</p>

<p>Exhibit B: Firefox Contextual Menu

<p>When I select â€œSearch Answers.com For â€˜perfectâ€™â€, Firefox opens a tab in the background searching Google for the word that I had selected. To me, this is clearly the best option.</p>

<p>Safariâ€™s search function is complemented by a â€œSearch in Spotlightâ€ option that Iâ€™ve never used. I suppose its nice that its here, but still, never used. The ability to search the built in dictionary is nice, and I think I may have used that function once.</p>

<p>Exhibit C:  Safari Contextual Menu

<p>The problem I have with Safariâ€™s search Google option is that it replaces the tab that Iâ€™m reading instead of opening up another tab. Clearly this defeats the purpose, Iâ€™m interested in the word, product, or service that Iâ€™m reading about, but I donâ€™t want to stop reading to search Google. I want Google to be there in the background waiting for me when Iâ€™m good and ready. Firefox has this right, and I think both Safari and Omniweb could stand to adopt this feature.</p>
