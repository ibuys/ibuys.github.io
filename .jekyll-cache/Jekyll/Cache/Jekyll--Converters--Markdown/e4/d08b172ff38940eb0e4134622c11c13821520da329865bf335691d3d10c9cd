I"í<p>Iâ€™ve been thinking lately. Iâ€™d like to bring you along for the ride. We live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times">interesting times</a>, thereâ€™s so much going on that Iâ€™m not sure all of us really understand where we are, what weâ€™re doing, and the effect all of this has on us. To understand the present, and catch a glimpse of the future, youâ€™ve got to first understand the past. So, letâ€™s take a trip down memory lane. Specifically, my memory lane, letâ€™s start in the mid 1980â€™s.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s something about the mountains and the woods that can make a boy feel <em>lost</em>, I mean absolutely missing from the world. I grew up dirt poor, but for a while we lived in a trailer next to what my childish mind thought of as a grand and magical forrest. Iâ€™d spend hours wandering through the woods, and my favorite spot was a little mound that sat out into the pond in the center of the grove. I would sit on this mound and feel the sunshine on my face, watch the water, inspect the insects flying around the pond or skimming across the surface of the water. Iâ€™d imagine that the trees went on forever in all directions, and fashion swords and guns from sticks to play my own games alone in the woods. Until I hit a road that went through the area, then the spell would be broken and Iâ€™d turn away from it, hoping to find the magic again. I had time to be outside, to be alone with my thoughts and my imagination.</p>

<p>When I got a little older my parents bought me a BMX bike. I <em>loved</em> that thing. Iâ€™d race it, ride it around on dirt trails with jumps and hills and trees. I had one of the worst accidents of my life on that bike, took half my face off and gave me a serious concussion<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The early 90â€™s was high school for me. After getting my drivers license Iâ€™d take my car out on some winding road, find a place to pull off and hike into the woods a bit. Iâ€™d find a nice rock somewhere overlooking the valley, and spend some time sitting and thinking, looking out over the tops of evergreen pines reaching all the way to the lake. Taking a different road Iâ€™d wind up at the dam, and a few of us brave and stupid enough would hop the fence off of the walkway and climb out onto the cliffs where weâ€™d find seats of rock on the edge with the best view of the valley and the river below<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. Sometimes some friends and I would camp out around a fire and spend the night watching the flames and the stars.</p>

<p>I grew up with the desire and the means to seek out peace and solitude. Like many kids my age I had time to think, to let my mind wander. When I went to find my solitude, <strong>no one knew where I was</strong>, no one could reach me in an emergency. There were no cell phones, no internet, no Twitter or Facebook or Snapchat or whatever else. I never once worried that I was being followed or tracked. I never thought about something recording my voice for a stranger across the world to listen to. I was out. I might be back later.</p>

<p>What Iâ€™ve been thinkingâ€¦Â what Iâ€™m afraid of, is that my generation might have been the last generation to have that childhood. To have the privacy to go where you like and be alone with your thoughts in long, uninterrupted blocks of time. From what I can tell, this is because of a number of overlapping factors, but I think we could probably focus on two: â€œavailability of technologyâ€ and â€œ<em>fear</em>â€.</p>

<p>The world we live in today is so different than the one I grew up in, more so, I think, than generations that came before. I didnâ€™t think about how large corporations were assembling dossiers on me, what I liked, what I didnâ€™t like, where Iâ€™ve been, where Iâ€™ve lived, who Iâ€™m friends with, what I buy, what I read. We are what we repeatedly do, so, in a way, these corporations know us better than anyone on earth. Maybe better than we know ourselves.</p>
