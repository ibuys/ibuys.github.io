  <p>You donâ€™t have to pretend to be a family to be courteous Or kind. Or protective. All those values can be expressed even better in principles, policies, and, most importantly, actions</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve worked with companies that do this, and it always feltâ€¦ <em>weird</em>. I didnâ€™t want to have a family, I just wanted to do great work for an organization with a mutually beneficial arrangement Thatâ€™s not to say that you canâ€™t form close bonds with those you work with, or have a deep appreciation for the company you work for, but it can never, and should never, take the place of your actual family.</p>
