I"¾<p>Yesterday, Go2 was one of approximately 1000 applications available on launch day of the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/go2/id407815526?mt=12">Mac App Store</a>. Itâ€™s been a nerve wracking experience, but overall Iâ€™m pretty happy so far with the way its gone.  Iâ€™ve been able to identify a couple of last minute bugs and get their fixes incorporated into version 1.1, which Iâ€™ve had in beta testing for about a month now.</p>
