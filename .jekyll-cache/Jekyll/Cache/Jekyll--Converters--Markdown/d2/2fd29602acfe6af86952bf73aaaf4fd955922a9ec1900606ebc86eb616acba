I"À<p>Iâ€™m in St. Louis for the <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com">Strange Loop conference</a>, and the conference kicked off last night with a party at the <a href="https://www.citymuseum.org">City Museum</a>. I didnâ€™t bother to look into the museum much before I came. A few friends told me a bit about it, but it wasnâ€™t enough for me to really understand what the museum was; the City Museum isnâ€™t a museum, its a mad amusement park.</p>
