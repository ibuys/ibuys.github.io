I"›<p>Iâ€™ve never been 100% happy with this site. On the one hand, Jekyll lets me have full control of my content, and I never have to worry about losing any of it or having anything locked inside a database on a server somewhere. On the other hand, things like adding media is more complicated than Iâ€™d like. Iâ€™ve written scripts to help, of course, but Iâ€™d really rather have the best of both worlds.</p>
