I"–<p>The recent hubbub about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/apples_terrible_no_good_very_bad_earnings_warning">Appleâ€™s earnings guidance</a> has â€œanalystsâ€ and pundits talking a lot about China and the global economic situation. Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s something to all that, but my take is simplerâ€¦ the new iPhones are priced too high.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not ready to spend a thousand bucks on a new phone, even though the X-series looks very nice. Iâ€™ve talked to several other people who feel the same way I do, one just this morning, even though we are both still running the 6S. Personally, at this price, Iâ€™ll keep running my phone till it doesnâ€™t work anymore.</p>

<p>Of course, if Apple came out with a real successor to the iPhone SE, maybe an X-series SE at a similar price point as the previous SE, Iâ€™d be very interested in that. But, weâ€™ll see how the next year or so plays out.</p>
