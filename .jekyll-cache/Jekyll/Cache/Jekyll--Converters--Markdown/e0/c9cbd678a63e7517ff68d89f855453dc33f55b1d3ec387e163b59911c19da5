I"<p>Every so often I get the inkling to make this site more than what it is. Since 2008 I’ve been writing fairly regularly here about whatever comes to mind, and in doing so I’ve covered several topics. I’ve written about <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/11-07-2010/Android-Marketplace.html">Android</a> and <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/01-27-2011/Keyboard_Driven_Safari.html">Mac geekery</a>, <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/01-16-2011/from_zero_to_the_app_store.html">success</a> and <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/07-09-2011/The_Experiment.html">failure</a> in Mac development, <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/03-11-2011/Dazzle_Them_With_Science.html">business</a>, <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/10-10-2010/Clean-and-Clutter-Free.html">psychology</a>, <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/10-09-2009/Linux_Hidden_ARP.html">systems administration</a>, personal <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/03-25-2007/change-and-blessing.html">stories</a>, and <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/10-01-2010/The-Smell-of-Salt.html">memories</a>. More than anything, I have tried to <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/02-15-2011/Be_Great.html">inspire</a> others, and sometimes, if I’m very, very lucky, I <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/09-10-2008/on-graduation-day.html">succeed</a>.</p>
