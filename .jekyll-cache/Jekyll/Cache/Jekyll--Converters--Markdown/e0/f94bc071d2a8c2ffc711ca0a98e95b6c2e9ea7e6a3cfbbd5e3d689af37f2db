I" <p>Iâ€™ve been a Mac user since returning to the states in 2003, but Iâ€™ve been a Unix user for a few years longer. Originally, I was drawn to the Mac because it was a fantastic interface on top of a solid BSD Unix core, but as I grew more familiar with the platform, I became more drawn to the level of attention to detail. The Mac is a quality machine, but today Iâ€™m writing this on a Dell running FreeBSD.</p>
