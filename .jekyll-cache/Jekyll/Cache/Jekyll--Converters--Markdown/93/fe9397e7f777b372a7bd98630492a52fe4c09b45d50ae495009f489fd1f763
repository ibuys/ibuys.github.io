I"T<p>The venerable BBEdit recently received a <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html">big upgrade</a>, and looks poised to attract users of TextMate, which, by all accounts, has been abandoned by its developer. I tried to love BBEdit, but it always felt like trying on someone elseâ€™s clothes. They might look good, but that does not mean the clothes will be comfortable for you. Recent conversations about text editors on <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze">Build and Analyze</a> led me to rethink my position, and examine in more detail how I came to choose MacVim.</p>
