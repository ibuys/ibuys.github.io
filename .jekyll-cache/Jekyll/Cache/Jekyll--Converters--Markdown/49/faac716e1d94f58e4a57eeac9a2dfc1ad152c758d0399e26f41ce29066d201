I"¦<p>I deleted my twitter account this morning. Iâ€™ve been on Twitter long enough to remember when it was spelled twttr, and there was a SMS bridge to a specific number, 40404 if I remember correctly. For me, itâ€™s always been a fun place to chat about Apple and technology. Twitter was a place to learn about new tech and be part of the community of developers, designers, and enthusiasts. Through Twitter Iâ€™ve found apps I use every day, books that I love, Authors to follow. Weâ€™ve chatted live through Apple keynotes, commisserated through hard times, and found common interests across the world. Butâ€¦ thatâ€™s just not what Twitter is anymore. At least not to me.</p>
