  <p>It will require a struggle to make America reality-based again. Fight the good fight in your private life. You neednâ€™t get into an argument with the stranger at Chipotle who claims that George Soros and Uber are plotting to make his muscle car illegalâ€”but do not give acquaintances and friends and family members free passes. If you have children or grandchildren, teach them to distinguish between true and untrue as fiercely as you do between right and wrong and between wise and foolish. 
We need to adopt new protocols for information-media hygiene. Would you feed your kids a half-eaten casserole a stranger handed you on the bus, or give them medicine you got from some lady at the gym? 
And fight the good fight in the public sphere. One main task, of course, is to contain the worst tendencies of Trumpism, and cut off its political-economic fuel supply, so that fantasy and lies donâ€™t turn it into something much worse than just nasty, oafish, reality-show pseudo-conservatism. Progress is not inevitable, but itâ€™s not impossible, either.</p>

<p>A fascinating historical perspective of how we got to where we are today by Kurt Andersen writing for The Atlantic. Andersen focuses on how the counterculture movements of the â€™60s morphed into a widespread belief in conspiracy theories adopted and expounded on by the right. Long, but well worth the time.</p>
