I"Ü<p>I believe this will be the last I muck about with the design of the site for the foreseeable future. After being disappointed by the available themes, and further disappointed by my own design ability, I went back to basics. And by basics I mean that I found a few sites that I like the look of and copied large chunks of HTML and CSS to build a custom Jekyll theme.</p>

<p>Readers of Brent Simmonsâ€™ <a href="http://inessential.com">Inessential</a> site will probably recognize the fonts and general layout. Iâ€™ve added navigation at the top, minimized the layout to bare HTML5 tags, and setup some color here and there. Iâ€™ve also set up a bit of responsiveness for media, and syntax highlighting for code blocks. My hope is that this will be a good baseline for any future work I put into the site, but attribution must be made first.</p>

<p>I enjoy the simplicity of the design, and how clean and readable it is now. I especially like that there is no Javascript in use. Nothing but pure HTML and CSS. No tracking, no stats, nothing dynamic or fancy. Itâ€™s just you, me, and the text.</p>

  <p>PS. Brent was kind enough to give his blessing to the new design, for which Iâ€™m greatly appreciative.</p>
