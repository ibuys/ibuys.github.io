I"“<p>I just started reading <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Cal Newportâ€™s <em>Deep Work</em></a> and Iâ€™ve found myself nodding along in agreement through the introduction and first two chapters. His description of the environment needed for intense, concentrated study reminded me of a time I went through a period of deep work, one that is unfortunately difficult to replicate.</p>
