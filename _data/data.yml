    summary: |
      For over 20 years I've designed, built, and managed secure & scaleable Unix and Linux system architectures. Starting in the United States Navy as a Radioman, I've continually increased my knowledge and added to my skill set. I've run and terminated fiber optic cables, managed networking equipment, built automatic failover systems for databases, developed my own Mac applications in Objective-C, and now I manage autoscaling cloud infrastructure. I accept and overcome the hardest problems.
