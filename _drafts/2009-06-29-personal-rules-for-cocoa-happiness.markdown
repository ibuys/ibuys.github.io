1. Understand every line of code written in my apps
2. Use [frameworks][1] sparingly (see rule 1).
3. Do not copy and paste code (see rule 1).
4. Add lots of comments so I remember what I was doing at any given time.
5. Manage memory as I go, don't wait until I'm nearly finished and then go and "clean it up".
6. Draw out the application on paper before writing a single line of code.
7. Search Apple's documentation, CocoaDev mailing list archives, Google, and anything else I can think of before asking for help.
8. When programming, quit Mail, Twitter, NetNewsWire, and IM. Turn on some non-distracting music in iTunes.
9. Get a cup of coffee.
10. Remember, "[This is hard, you are not stupid][2]."
