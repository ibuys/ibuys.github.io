John Siracusa hung up his cape today, [announcing on his blog](http://hypercritical.co/2015/04/15/os-x-reviewed) that he would no longer be reviewing OS X. 

> Nearly 15 years ago, I wrote my first review of Mac OS X for a nascent “PC enthusiast’s" website called Ars Technica. Nearly 15 years later, I wrote my last. Though Apple will presumably announce the next major version of OS X at WWDC this coming June, I won’t be reviewing it for Ars Technica or any other publication, including the website you’re reading now.

It's a bittersweet moment for those of us who have been following John for over a decade, but it's well deserved, and the volume of work that he's left is a wonderful gift to the community. 

John's explanation of Spotlight in the [OS X 10.4 review](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2005/04/macosx-10-4/9/) was fundamental in my understanding of OS X as not just another Unix system. OS X is something different, something more. I remember this part in particular blowing my mind: 

> Any file i/o that goes through the Tiger kernel will trigger the appropriate metadata importer. This kernel-level integration ensures that the Spotlight indexes are always up to date.

Read the whole thing, actually, start at the beginning and read every review from [DP2](http://arstechnica.com/apple/1999/12/macos-x-dp2/)to [Yosemite](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/10/os-x-10-10/). His unapologetically deep dives into the details of OS X were something I and a lot of other geeks on the Internet looked forward to with each release. 

Siracusa's reviews are required reading for anyone wanting a better understanding of how and why their Mac works the way that it does. I'm looking forward to the published, hardcover book, if it ever comes.
