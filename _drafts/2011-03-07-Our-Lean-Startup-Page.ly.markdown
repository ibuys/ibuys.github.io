>There is no profit margin on mediocre. While every company including ours has its hiccups as it grows we set the bar on day one to offer a premium service and priced it as such. We are unapologetic about it.

I'm always wary of free services. I like knowing who I'm dealing with and what our business relationship is, preferably with me being the customer, and them providing me with goods or services in exchange for money. Very simple. Services based on advertising revenue will eventually start preferring the advertiser over the user of the service.

For example, take the recent [Twitter app update](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/06/dickbar). Twitter is a great service, fun to use and interesting in how it allows you to connect to people. But, it's free, and since its free we have never been Twitter's customers. As such, the recent update introduces a new "quickbar" which annoyingly obscures the tweets we want to read with a trending topic we couldn't care less about. This happened because Twitter needs to please the people who are giving them money. I would much prefer the ability to pay for the service. Paying for Twitter would reduce spam and refocus the company on what really matters; people.
