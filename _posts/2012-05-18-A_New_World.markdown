CocoaHeads changed my life. This afternoon I am killing time in a coffee shop, about to head to work for an appointment with HR. When I get there, I'll turn in my badge, they will wish me luck, and I'll walk out the door. Monday, I start a new chapter in my life with [T8 Webware][1]. To say that I'm a little nervous about this change would be an understatement. I've spent time with these guys, they are smart, ambitious, and I believe in what they are doing. I'm going to be part of building something awesome, and I'm extremely excited.

I met the guys from T8 at CocoaHeads months ago. We got to talking, and found that we had mutual interests. We met for lunch, I visited their main office (which is beautiful, by the way), we had lunch again, we talked and talked, and they made me an offer. My life is changing because I took the time to learn something new, and to reach out to others who shared the my interests. [Go2][2] will never make me independently wealthy, but it did open up new doors and bring me to meet people and have experiences I would have missed out on otherwise.  

I haven't been to a CocoaHeads meeting lately. Between raising my family and finishing my masters degree, I haven't had the time. Now that things are falling back into place, I think I owe them a visit.
