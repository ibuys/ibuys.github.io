OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion was released today, accompanied by a handful of reviews by the best tech sites.

1. [OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion: the Ars Technica review][1], John Siracusa 
2. [Mountain Lion][2], John Gruber
3. [Mountain Lion and the Simplification of OS X][3], Shawn Blanc
4. [Apple releases OS X Mountain Lion][4], Jim Dalrymple
5. [OS X Mountain Lion][5], MacWorld

Just for kicks, don't miss Marco Arment's [Review of John Siracusaâ€™s Review of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion][6], as well as John Siracusa [writing about writing][7] his Mountain Lion reveiw.

As for me, this is the first major upgrade of OS X that I do not see a compelling reason to upgrade right away. I plan to give it a day or two first.
