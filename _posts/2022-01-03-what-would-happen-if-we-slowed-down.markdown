> If you worked deeply and regularly on a reasonable portfolio of initiatives that move the needle, and were sufficiently organized to keep administrative necessities from dropping through the cracks, your business probably wouldnâ€™t implode, and your job roles would likely still be fulfilled. This shift from a state of slightly too much work to not quite enough, in other words, might be less consequential than we fear.

This reminds me of initiatives to cut down to a 4-day work week. If I remember correctly, tests have shown that productivity does not go down, and workers have a better quality of life.
