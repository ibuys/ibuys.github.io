Late last month the domain for this site expired. I had plenty of warning, ample time to log into the Hover dashboard and renew it myself. I could have even left the auto-renew on, like I have  for the past twelve years, but this year was different. This year was the end of 2020, and at the time I felt I had enough of the internet. It was time to log off, possibly forever. 

The internet had become a toxic place for me, full of political arguments and outrage, it felt like every time I logged on I was watching everything burn around me, and I didn't want to be a part of it anymore. I left Facebook years ago, I left Twitter in 2020, and I was using my blog to rant about political issues, which was never the intention of this site. This site is here for me to practice writing, to share what I've learned, and to force me to think things through[^1]. It's a repository of my thoughts on the tech industry over time, and a reflection of where I've been in my career and mindset. 

I didn't want this site to be something that I knew would start arguments with people I love. My wife and I both got COVID-19 about this same time. There was a lot going on. I let it go. 

But then… January 20th rolled around, and 2021 officially started, and with the new year I suddenly felt lighter, more optimistic about the future. I started thinking about sharing tidbits I've learned, and I started thinking about the work I've put into this site over the years. I remembered how much I enjoyed "blogging" as a hobby, when it was a hobby.

I'm seeing the world with fresh eyes this new year, and I hope you are too. There's certainly a lot to look forward to, especially as a Mac user. New rumors about M1 MacBook Pros, iMacs, and possibly even the [elusive xMac](https://arstechnica.com/staff/2005/10/1676/) finally making an appearance all have me thinking this might have to be an upgrade year. 

I'm also picking up a couple of new hobbies this year. I bought myself an entry-level mountain bike that's a big step up from the old Walmart special I've had for almost a decade. I'm looking forward to exploring the trails around central Iowa. I'm also waiting for a telescope to be delivered. I've got an iPhone mount for it, and I'm hoping to be able to do some very, very basic astrophotography. I'll post what I learn as I go. 

They say that getting old means that your sense of time gets warped, one day merges into the next into the next. The days all start to look the same as months turn into years. The fight against that is to never stop learning, to never stop exploring. Novelty is what fights old age, it's having things worth remembering. 

What do you say we make 2021 *worth remembering*?
