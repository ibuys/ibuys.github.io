#### The Recovery Kit Version Two


- [Jay Doscher](https://www.doscher.com/recovery-kit-version-2/)

> If you're not familiar with the Recovery Kit, it's something I made back in 2019 and posted to my original back7.co blog. I created it before I knew what a "cyberdeck" was beyond a simple part of William Gibson's Neuromancer. I wanted a rugged computer enclosure for my Raspberry Pi, and I'd been unhappy with overly simplistic and cheap cases for the Raspberry Pi at the time. I had some projects in mind for GPIO, but sadly many of those haven't come to light since I made the Recovery Kit 5 years ago.

Cool idea. 

#### Beautifying Org Mode in Emacs

[zzamboni.org](https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/)

> Over the last few months, I have used org-mode more and more for writing and programming in Emacs. I love its flexibility and power, and it is the first literate programming tool which “feels right”, and I have been able to stick with it for a longer period of time than in my previous attempts.

Very nice, almost enough to convince me to check out Emacs agian. Almost. 

#### Getting the Grid to Net Zero

A pair of links for this one, one from each point of view:

- [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-inverter)

> Ultimately, though, electricity generation that is completely carbon free in its operation is within our grasp. Our challenge now is to make the leap from small to large to very large systems. We know what we have to do, and it will not require technologies that are far more advanced than what we already have.

More of this, please. 

#### Means of Control

- [Nick Heer](https://pxlnv.com/blog/means-of-control/)

> “The success lies in the secrecy” is a shibboleth of the private surveillance industry, as described in Byron Tau’s new book, “[Means of Control](https://www.indiebookstores.ca/book/9780593443224/)”. It is easy to find parallels to my opening anecdote throughout though, to be clear, a direct comparison to human-led ecological destruction is a knowingly exaggerated metaphor. The erosion of privacy and civil liberties is horrifying in its own right, and shares key attributes: those in the industry knew what they were doing and allowed it to persist because it was lucrative and, in a post-9/11 landscape, ostensibly justified.

Fantastic essay over at Pixel Envy. 

#### The Meat Grinder

- [Keenan](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/the-meat-grinder)

> Even in my brief time with them over a decade ago, I witnessed too many people ground up in Apple's pursuit of more. No matter how much you may believe that they are ultimately a force of good in the world, remember that if it ever became a choice between you and selling another iPhone, that iPhone is going to get sold. You don't win capitalism through altruism. [Apple is not the exception to the rule: there are no exceptions](https://inessential.com/2024/01/17/corporations_are_not_to_be_loved).

Apple's not the scrappy underdog it used to be.
