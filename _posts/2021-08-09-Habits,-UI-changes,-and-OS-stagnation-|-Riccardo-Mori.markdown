Riccardo Mori posting last month on how macOS has stagnated roughly since Lion. 

> And with Mac OS it feels like its journey is over, the operating system has found a place to settle and has remained there for years. Building new stuff, renovating, rearranging, etc., but always on site, so toÂ speak.

This reminds me of a [post I wrote in 2018](https://jonathanbuys.com/A_New_macOS/) about some features I'd love to see in the Mac. I'm still waiting for anything I wrote about to be shipped.
