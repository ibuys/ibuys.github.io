The book of Philippians is such a beautiful, and challenging book. This is what I needed to hear tonight:

> *Do all things without grumbling or questioning*, that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did no run in vain or labor in vain.
> Philippians 2:14-16

 I admit I've done quite a bit of grumbling and questioning the past few days. On the next page, I saw I had this passage marked:

> Rejoice in the Lord always, again I say rejoice. Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; *do not be anxious about anything*, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.*Â And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus*.
> Finally brothers, **whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there his anything worthy of praise, think about these things**. What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me--practice these things, and *the God of peace will be with you*.
> Philippians 4:4-9

* "... you shine as lights in the world..."
* "... And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus"
* "...and the God of peace will be with you."

God of peace, guard my heart and my mind, and let me shine as your light in the world.
