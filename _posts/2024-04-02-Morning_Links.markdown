## Daring Fireball - Trump Media Plunges as Truth Social’s $58 Million

[Link](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/01/trump-media-plunges)

> I want to laugh, but: If Trump is elected again in November — which, based on the close results of 2016 and 2020, and the current polling data, is definitely possible — shaking down lobbyists and foreign governments with exorbitant rates for ads on Truth Social seems like a much better grift than running a hotel across the street from the White House. A corrupt president owning a social media site would be a grift that scales. If there’s any rational reason for Trump Media to have any value at all, it’s that. It’s worthless today, but could be a veritable goldmine in a second Trump administration.

I originally went to link to this by saying "couldn't have happened to a nicer person", but Gruber's last paragraph resonates. I'd like to think it could never happen again, but I never expected it could happen a first time. 


## Daring Fireball - Donald Trump’s Easter Madness

> It’s 168 words, the first 165 of which are (ostensibly) a single sentence.

My favorite part is when Trump starts referring to himself in the third-person. 


## 10 Best Ultralight Backpacks of 2024

Good overview of hiking backpacks. I've had my eye on the REI Flash 55, but my son-in-law has lots of good things to say about Osprey. Not committing yet, but if I learned anything from my last trip it's that I absolutely need a new pack. And a new sleeping bag. 


## Dr. Drang - Structural continuity and the Francis Scott Key Bridge

> The key to keeping bridges up over navigable waters is to build independent protective structures near—but not too near—the piers. The [protective structures](https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchCode=LCCN&searchArg=79016710&searchType=1&permalink=y) can get damaged by impact as long as they don’t transfer the load into the pier they’re meant to protect (that’s the “independent” part). Dr. Aghayere questioned the lack of protective structures in [his interview](https://6abc.com/baltimore-bridge-collapse-safety-construction-drexel-university/14574047/), and he got that part exactly right.

Excellent article by the good doctor, as always. 

## Basic Apple Guy - MacBook

> For this year's diabolical April Fools’ Day post, I pulled on the heartstrings of those still pining for the return of a 12-inch MacBook and those wanting to see Apple infuse a bit more colour into their product lineup and created a series of fake press/website images imagining a collection of colourful 12-inch MacBooks!

Wow, if Apple released these today I might go into hock to buy at least one. Beautiful work.

> If your passion or livelihood depends on a set of tools or capabilities, don't rent those tools from someone who can deny you access4 or claim your output5 at any time. Own your tools. Be a digital homesteader.

I like the idea, but I also like the idea of paying real money for the best in class tools.

It's a link post to a link post, but for this one I think it's worth it. I'm still thinking through the ramifications of this hack, but it needs to be taken seriously.

> 15 iPhone Shortcuts YOU Requested: Auto-Texting, Alarms, Music, and More


Well, to be clear, I didn't request any. I've yet to find a compelling use for Shortcuts on my phone, and on my Mac Keyboard Maestro is head and shoulders above the Shortcuts port. However, it is fun to see people investing time and effort into creative workflows.
