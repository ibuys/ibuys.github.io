Finding good design in open source can be hard, but it’s almost impossible to find in open source news sites. These sites take “reader hostile” to a new level. Take example “A”, Phoronix:

<img src="/media/phoronix-ads.png" />

The advertisement completely obstructs the text. Once the ad is closed, which I’m assuming counts as a “click”, the site is not too terrible to read. Of course, it’s no Daring Fireball. 

The problem is compounded when using an aggregator site like Linux Today. Initially, it looks like a series of links:

<img src="/media/linuxtoday1.png" />

But, as soon as you click on a link, another full screen, text obstructing ad appears.


<img src="/media/linuxtoday2.png" />

OK, fine, close the ad, and see that you still have another link to click on to get to the article you want to read.

<img src="/media/linuxtoday3.png" />

Now I’m wondering just how much I care about the Debian Civil War (spoiler: not much), but by this time, I’m invested, let’s read that article. Click the Complete Story link.

<img src="/media/linuxtoday4.png" />

Nope! Close the ad, and, finally, find the text I was looking for.

<img src="/media/linuxtoday5.png" />

Has it really come to this? Apparently.
