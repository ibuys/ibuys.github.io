Yosemite 10.10.3 brought a few subtle, but welcome changes to the interface used to look up a word. I normally access this by tapping on a word with three fingers on the trackpad, or right clicking the Magic Mouse and selecting "Look Up". Since I often read above my level of comprehension, I use this feature all the time. 

Apple added the iBooks bookstore alongside the dictionary, thesaurus, and Wikipedia. <strike>Also, since I'm just getting back into screencasting and needed some practice, here's a goofy video I made with a basic Garageband loop to accompany it.</strike>

I'm looking for a new delivery method for hosting videos on this site. I'll update this post with the goofy video once I've sorted it out.
