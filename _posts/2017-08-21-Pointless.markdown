I can find no objectively positive outcome to arguing about politics, and even less to obsessively following it on the news and social media. Every day, several times a day, I find myself online, checking to see what the latest horrible thing Trump said or did was. Then I browse the right-wing sites to see how they spin it to a positive, and call everyone else blind fools or liars. Sometimes I read the comments, which are filled with name-calling, off-topic rants, half-truths, misdirection,  and outright lies. I read this, and I get angry. 

*And for what*? It's not a voting year, I'm never going to run for office. What is the point of all this angst? Why should I allow myself to be internally influenced so by events that I have no control over? I can't find a reason, and for the past couple of days I've been thinking back to when Twitter was for chatting about Apple and Macs. I went to Twitter to be inspired about the future, how technology was going to make our lives better. Things have changed. 

The best thing I can do is to live my life in the best way I can think of. To live out the values that I claim. To keep my faith in God, to be a good husband and father to my family, a good friend to the people I know. Exercise, eat right, get a good nights sleep. Grow some vegetables in the garden. Take the dog on a walk and breath deep, closing my eyes and feeling the sun on my face. These things are good, lasting. 

This is how you win a political argument. You live the best life you can, happy and content. 

There are so many better uses for our time. Gardening I've mentioned, painting, bird watching, playing a musical instrument, learning a new skill, woodworking and carpentry, computer programming. There are thousands of books that are more worth our while reading than the daily news. 

I've seen no evidence that arguing about politics will have the intended outcome of changing the other persons mind. In that case, why bother at all? I'll have an answer ready for anyone who asks, but I'm not going to be drawn into political arguments anymore, especially those using pre-defined partisan talking points. There is literally no point to it, and it makes for a poor hobby.
