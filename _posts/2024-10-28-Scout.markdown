I'm rooting for these guys. If they can pull off this truck at the $50-$60k mark, I think they are going to have a winner. I've been looking at electric trucks for a while, and I'm excited to see another entry in the market. And what a fantastic video:

A proper body-on-frame truck, 10,000 lb towing capacity, all electric, made in the USA. Count me in.
