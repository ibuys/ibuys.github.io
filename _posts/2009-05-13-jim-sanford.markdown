    My Mama said if I’d be good, she’d send me to the store.
    She said she’d bake some gingerbread if I would sweep the floor.
    She said if I would make the beds and watch the telephone,
    She would send me out to buy a chocolate ice cream cone.
    
    And so I did, the things she said
    And she made me some gingerbread.
    Then I went out, just me alone
    And I bought me a chocolate ice cream cone.
    
    Now on the way home, I stubbed my toe upon a big ol’ stone.
    Need I tell you that I dropped my chocolate ice cream cone.
    A little doggy came along and took a great big lick.
    So I hit that little doggy with a great big stick.
    And he bit me, where I sit down.
    And he chased me all over town.
    And now I’m lost…can’t find my home.
    All because of a chocolate ice cream cone!

[Good night][1] Papa, we love you.
