The recent hubbub about [Apple's earnings guidance][1] has "analysts" and pundits talking a lot about China and the global economic situation. I'm sure there's something to all that, but my take is simplerâ€¦ the new iPhones are priced too high.

I'm not ready to spend a thousand bucks on a new phone, even though the X-series looks very nice. I've talked to several other people who feel the same way I do, one just this morning, even though we are both still running the 6S. Personally, at this price, I'll keep running my phone till it doesn't work anymore.

Of course, if Apple came out with a real successor to the iPhone SE, maybe an X-series SE at a similar price point as the previous SE, I'd be very interested in that. But, we'll see how the next year or so plays out.
