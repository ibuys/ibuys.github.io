>You don’t have to pretend to be a family to be courteous Or kind. Or protective. All those values can be expressed even better in principles, policies, and, most importantly, actions

I've worked with companies that do this, and it always felt… *weird*. I didn't want to have a family, I just wanted to do great work for an organization with a mutually beneficial arrangement That's not to say that you can't form close bonds with those you work with, or have a deep appreciation for the company you work for, but it can never, and should never, take the place of your actual family.
