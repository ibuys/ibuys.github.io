> Here’s how you set up your single screenshots folder: 
> * Open a Finder window and click on iCloud Drive 
> * Create a new folder called Screenshots 
> * In Terminal, type these commands: 
> 	* defaults write com.apple.screencapture location \
> “~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Screenshots/” 
> 	* killall SystemUIServer

Another great tip from Cricket. I'll be setting this up on my Macs from now on.
