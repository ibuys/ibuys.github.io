I was listening to [Core Intuition][1] a few weeks back and Manton said that if anyone was interested in his project to let him know, and he would send a couple of stickers. I was interested, so I emailed him a quick note, and quickly forgot about it.

Yesterday an envelope arrived in the mail with two stickers and a handwritten note. I'm looking forward to his new project, that [Manton Reece][2] seems like a stand-up guy.
