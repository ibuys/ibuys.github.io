#### The Cloud Under the Sea


- [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/c/24070570/internet-cables-undersea-deep-repair-ships)

>  The world’s emails, TikToks, classified memos, bank transfers, satellite surveillance, and FaceTime calls travel on cables that are about as thin as a garden hose. There are about 800,000 miles of these skinny tubes crisscrossing the Earth’s oceans, representing nearly 600 different systems, according to the industry tracking organization TeleGeography. The cables are buried near shore, but for the vast majority of their length, they just sit amid the gray ooze and alien creatures of the ocean floor, the hair-thin strands of glass at their center glowing with lasers encoding the world’s data. 

Fantastic article, reading it I'm nostalgic for my time as a Sailor in the US Navy. If I was a younger man, I might be tempted to seek out a position on one of these ships.
