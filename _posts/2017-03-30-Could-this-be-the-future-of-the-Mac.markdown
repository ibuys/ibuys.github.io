Spoiler: yes.

> Back to the headline. Could this be the future of the Mac? As iPhone processing power increases, could Apple create a hybrid desktop product driven by some future version of the A10 Fusion (the 64-bit system on a chip that drives the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus), a product that looks and acts like an iPhone, but that doubles as a desktop experience when you plug it into a dock, complete with large display, mouse, and keyboard?

I've been saying this is the future [for years][2]. This is the only direction that makes sense. Given enough computing power a phone will eventually be the only device we need.
