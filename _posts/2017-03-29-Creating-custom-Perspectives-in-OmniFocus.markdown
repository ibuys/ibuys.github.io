> Perspectives in OmniFocus allow you to include additional task details like due date, defer date, flag status, and project status to customize your task views even further. If you wanted to see only tasks that are available to be worked on right now, require you to have access to your Mac, and are due next week, perspectives allow you to find the tasks that meet this criteria quickly and easily.

Without OmniFocus, I'm positive there are important things in my life that would not get done. OmniFocus helps me to forget about when to take the trash to the curb, when to pay bills, and when to change the oil in my jeep. It also helps me make sure that I'm making progress on all the projects I'm working on throughout the day. 

While I'm at work, I have an OmniFocus perspective that filters out everything that's not relevant that I've committed to working on today. Before and after work, I shift over to my "Today" perspective to see everything that I have on my plate for the day. 

OmniFocus is an essential piece of software for me, and I highly recommend it to anyone who feels like they have more to do than they can keep track of. In today's world, I imagine that's just about everyone.
