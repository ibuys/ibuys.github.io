I'm not sure what's going on over in Cupertino for them to think that *any* of the recent Apple Intelligence ads they've been running are a good idea. They're cringy at best, and honestly just flat out insulting. 


In one a [schlub writes an email](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m0MoYKwVTM) to his boss and uses AI to make it sound 'more professional', in another a young woman uses it to [lie about remembering an acquaintance's name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPe8revsg3k). In another the same young woman again uses it to [lie about reading an email](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eJy6QyHaFM) from a college, to her face, while she's sitting with her. In yet another, [linked to recently by Scott McNulty](https://blog.blankbaby.com/2024/10/apple-intelligence-smug-and-gross.html), a woman uses AI to lie to her husband about getting him something for his birthday. 

If this is what Apple thinks their AI is for, I honestly don't know that I want any part of it. 

Compare and contrast with the [video I posted yesterday](https://jonathanbuys.com/Scout/), and with this beautiful animation from Canonical.

I've watched that little animation several times, and they tell a better story in a minute twenty-five than all of Apple's AI commercials combined.
