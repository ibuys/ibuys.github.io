>You do what you do because it matters. At HP we don't just believe in the power of technology, we believe in the power of people, when technology works for you, to do the things that matter; to dream, to learn, to create, to work. If you are going to do something, make it matter.

Well done, HP. Certainly much better than the recent [Apple commercials][1].
