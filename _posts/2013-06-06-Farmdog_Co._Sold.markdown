*Update: July 30, 2013 - Farmdog is not closed, but I am rethinking everything. Paragraphs will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future.*

Farmdog Co. has closed. There had not been a single sale of Paragraphs for two weeks, and over three weeks since there was more than a single sale in a day. Farmdog was a fun project, but flawed in both concept and execution. 

For anyone looking for similar functionality to Paragraphs, I highly recommend [Byword 2.0][1] with Wordpress or [Jekyll][2].
