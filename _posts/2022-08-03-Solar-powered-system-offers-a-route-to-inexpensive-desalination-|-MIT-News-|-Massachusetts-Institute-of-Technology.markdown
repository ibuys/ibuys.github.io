> Now, a team of researchers at MIT and in China has come up with a solution to the problem of salt accumulation â€” and in the process developed a desalination system that is both more efficient and less expensive than previous solar desalination methods. The process could also be used to treat contaminated wastewater or to generate steam for sterilizing medical instruments, all without requiring any power source other than sunlight itself.


That's good news, more of this please.
