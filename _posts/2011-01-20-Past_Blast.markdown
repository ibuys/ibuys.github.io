I've loved reading some of the "Past Blast" articles that have been
linked about in Twitter, so here is my contribution.

*Two from Me*

[On Graduation Day][1], written after I, finally, finished my bachelors
degree. A personal accomplishment that means a lot to me.

[The Master Craftsman][2], solidifying the concept of my work as a craft,
whatever that work might be.

*One from Daring Fireball*

[The Life][3], I just wrote about this article, but I think linking to
it today is in keeping with the spirit of the meem.
