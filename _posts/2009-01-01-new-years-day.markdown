I love January 1st. It's not that this day is really any different from any other day, other than having the day off. Its the mental association that goes along with the start of a new year. The calendar restarts, and it seems like a fresh clean slate to build the rest of the year upon. I like resolutions, and I kept mine last year, so I'm going to try to keep another one this year. Last year I resolved to learn how to swim laps, and I did. I still swim fairly regularly now, and am actually looking forward to increasing how often I go swimming.  

When I return to work tomorrow, there will be no acknowledgment of the new years significance, but it will be in my mind. A fresh start, a clean slate, and another chance to build my life to be whatever I dream it can be.
