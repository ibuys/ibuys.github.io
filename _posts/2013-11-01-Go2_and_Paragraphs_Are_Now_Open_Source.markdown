I see no reason to keep the code for Go2 and Paragraphs to myself. I have no plans to continue developing them, have received no requests for support, and have seen very, very, few sales over the past few months. So, as of now, both [Go2](https://github.com/jbuys/Go2) and [Paragraphs](https://github.com/jbuys/Paragraphs) are released as open source, under the MIT license, available on GitHub. 

It is quite likely that there is a *ton* of bad code in there. Read through at your own risk.
