[The Tao of Cal - Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/the-tao-of-cal/)

> With the end of year rapidly approaching, and people finding themselves with some spare thinking time as work winds down for the holidays, I thought it might be fun to try to summarize essentially every major idea I discuss in one short primer.

I'm a big fan of Cal Newport's work. I'd like to quote the entire post, but I'll just post this one sentence. Read the rest of this article, then buy his books and read those too. Follow his advice and live a better life.
