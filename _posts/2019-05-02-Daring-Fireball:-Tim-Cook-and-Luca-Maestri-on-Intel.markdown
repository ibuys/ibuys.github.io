Tim Cook:
> For our Mac business overall, we faced some processor constraints in the March quarter, leading to a 5 percent revenue decline compared to last year. But we believe that our Mac revenue would have been up compared to last year without those constraints, and donâ€™t believe this challenge will have a significant impact on our Q3 results.

I have a feeling that it's less of an issue with the processor and more of an issue with the keyboard. CPU speed bumps have become nearly unnoticeable in day-to-day use, but this keyboard thing is a [PR nightmare](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/03/27/strn-kyboard).
