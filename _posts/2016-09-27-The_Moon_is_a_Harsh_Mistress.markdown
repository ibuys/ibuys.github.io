Amazon Prime really is the gift that keeps on giving. My latest discovery came in an email announcement from Amazon that they were making a selection of audiobooks from Audible available for free to prime members. All I needed to do is download the Audible app to my iPhone, log in with my Amazon credentials, and take my pick of titles to stream. 

The service is called [Audible Channels](https://www.amazon.com/gp/audible/channels), and includes a selection of audiobooks read by professional voice actors in different genres, "handcrafted playlists", which sounds like collections of podcasts, and original audio series, similar to the original content Amazon is producing for their video streaming service. 

I started off with some classic scifi from Robert Heinlein, [The Moon is a Harsh Mistress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress). I'm about three-quarters of the way through it so far, and I'm really enjoying the experience. The last time I got into audiobooks I was renting them as CDs from the local library. For the past week or so Audible has completely replaced listening to podcasts for me. I'm not sure how I feel about that. On the one hand, I feel the pang of not being along with "the guys" as they talk about whatever they are going to talk about for the week. On the other hand, listening to an audiobook is probably much healthier. I find literature far more enriching and personally satisfying than being a third party in a conversation I'm not actually a part of. 

The audioibooks are *long*. I think this one is about 16 hours of audio. I don't know how long it'll take me to get through everything available, but I'm sure I'll not be wanting for something to listen to for a long time to come.
