What do I *want* my purchases, the items that I own, to say about me? I'd like them to say that I'm thoughtful. That I'm a do-it-yourself'er. That I recognize that, as a Linux sysadmin, I've built my career on open source. The kind of person who builds his own computer, just like he builds his own shed, fixes his own car, and buys an old bicycle to refurbish and ride around town. The kind of person who grows a garden, but might want to put some monitoring system in the gardent to keep an eye on soil composition and moisture content. Or one who builds a weather station in the backyard and wants a hyperlocal weather forecast and see how it diverges from the local weather on tv. 

The kind of person who uses technology. Not the kind who is used *by* it. 

I am Apple's *ideal customer*. I've got a Mac, iPhone, AirPods Pro, Apple Watch, Apple TV (three of them), and I subscribe to Apple One. I've purchased Apple devices for family members, and hundreds of dollars of media from the store on Apple TV. I've been doing this for 20 years. I was an Apple developer for a short time. My app was in the Mac App Store on day one, with a following app in the store a  couple years later. I've written for Apple-focused publications, and evangalized the company to... well, anyone who'd listen. I met some friends through the local CocoaHeads group, some of whom now work at Apple. I've been steeped in the culture for a very long time. 

But, not as long as some. I didn't grow up with Apple, or computers at all. My first computer was a PC running Windows 98, which I quickly wiped and loaded Linux and several flavors of BSD on. If you go back far enough in this blog you'll see me complaining about Linux and suggesting ways to make it more "Mac-like". The thing is, there's something that's been bugging me for a while now. Something I need to write about to work out the logic of what I'm feeling, what's on my mind. I've made a career out of technology, but as much as I'd hoped it would, I've never been able to make my career focus on Apple. Sitting here today, I'd say that's a fact I'm profoundly grateful for. 

There are issues of culture, cost, practicality, and comfort. Each of which is valid, and each of which needs to be examined. I think the root of what I'm thinking comes down to answering the question: "how comfortable am I investing so much of my life in one of the biggest, most powerful companies that's ever existed?" And, the obvious following question: "what am I willing to do to change?"

In 2006 Mark Pilgrim wrote [When the bough breaks](https://web.archive.org/web/20060720231806/https://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks), where he detailed his decision to move to Ubuntu. 


Similar to our clothes, our cars, or where we live, a computer says something about who we are, and what's important to us. Which means my computer, my computing devices, say something about what's important to me. I remember being at a social event of some kind, maybe a party, and met a younger guy who was wearing Airpods Pro, an Apple Watch, and was mucking about with his iPhone. I at first dismissed this person as being too "showy", and being too obviously enthralled by his tech. And then I realized that this person was just like me. I've had a hard time reconsiling my initial thought with the reality of what my purchases say about me. 



Back in 2008 I wrote:

> The more important factor, and one that Linux seems to overlook more often than not, is what the user wants to *do* with the computer. Apple sells a total package, a computing utility. Linux was built by hobbyists and hackers, and piecemeal together. These design approaches are readily apparent in the gui, and the lengths that each takes to present a usable interface. The important point is not whither the user can perform a certain function, itâ€™s if the user needs the function, and if so, how easy is it for the user to do.

I still think about this. *What do I actually want to do?* What does my computer help me do? Why am I not comfortable in the beautiful walled garden anymore? 


Like the hypothetical frog boiling in water, Apple's been slowly turning up the heat. Now, 14 years later, I'm feeling like I've accepted more, and more, and more till the point where my technology doesn't represent the diy'er I actually am. I still care about design and usability, but not to the point where I'm entirely comfortable giving everything I have to a single technology company. 


My work as an engineering manager is all about writing code, interacting with people, doing research, and writing. Nothing about what I do day to day requires a Mac. But it used to be exciting to be able to use a Mac for work. Having a Mac made doing whatever the work was more *fun*. Things moved so fast in the early 2000's that there was always some new feature of surprise and delight around the corner. 

What I don't want my purchases to say about me is that I'm a nerd who spends too much of his free time in front of a computer. I don't want to be associated with the kind of online accounts with an anime avatar. That I don't care about physical fitness, or aesthetics, or... anything else in life outside of my computer. That's not the kind of person I am. 


Was it the move to subscriptions that was the turning point? Was it the focus on AI and not human capability? Was it when Apple came out wiht a $4000 VR headset with creepy projections of eyes on the front screen? Was it the increasingly cringy Apple keynote videos?

Was it everything?

Whatever it was, I saw that Ubuntu video linked at the top and as entranced. I must have watched that video twenty times, and I feel like I see something new every time.
