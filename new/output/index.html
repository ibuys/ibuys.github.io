<article><h2><a href='2024-12-19-Random_Strings_on_the_Command_Line.html'>Random Strings on the Command Line</a></h2>
<p>Browsing through some old files today I came across this note:</p>
<p>```
To Generate A Random String:</p>
<p>tr -dc A-Za-z0-9_ &lt; /dev/urandom | head -c 8 | xargs</p>
<p>```
Curios if it still worked I pasted it into my terminal and, unsurprisingly, was met with an error: </p>
<p><code>tr: Illegal byte sequence</code></p>
<p>The <code>tr</code> utility is one of the many old-school Unix programs with history reaching way back to System V. It stands for "translate characters", and with the <code>-dc</code> flags on, it should have ignored all input except for alphabet characters A-Z, both upper and lower case, and the integers 0 through 9, and the underscore character. The "Illegal byte sequence" error means it was really not happy with the input it was getting from <code>/dev/urandom</code>. </p>
<p>On macOS, the pseudo-device <code>/dev/urandom</code> is, according to the man page, "a compatibility nod to Linux". The device generates random bytes, so if we read it we'll get back raw binary data that looks like:</p>
<p><code>00010101 01011001 10111101</code></p>
<p>The reason the command is not working like it used to is because most modern computing system expect text character encoding to be UTF-8. When <code>tr</code> gets the string of random bytes from <code>/dev/urandom</code>, it expects the bytes to be in a specific sequence that it can translate into printable characters on the screen. Since we are intentionally generating random bytes though, we might get a few characters that translate properly, but eventually we'll encounter the "illegal byte sequence" error above. </p>
<p>To fix the problem, all we need to do is set <code>LC_ALL=C</code> before running <code>tr</code>:</p>
<p><code>LC_ALL=C tr -dc A-Za-z0-9_ &lt; /dev/urandom | head -c 14 | xargs</code></p>
<p>Setting <code>LC_ALL=C</code> sets the language setting back to POSIX, or the original C ASCII encoding for text. That means when <code>tr</code> is fed a random string of bytes, it interprets each byte as a character, according to the ASCII table, which looks something like this:</p>
<p>| Character | ASCII Decimal | ASCII Hexadecimal | Binary Representation |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| A         | 65            | 41                | 01000001              |
| B         | 66            | 42                | 01000010              |
| C         | 67            | 43                | 01000011              |</p>
<p>Now each byte is interpreted as a character that matches the list passed as an argument to <code>tr</code>. </p>
<p>```
➜ LC_ALL=C tr -dc A-Za-z0-9_ &lt; /dev/urandom | head -c 14 | xargs</p>
<p>Rhac_WGis7tHzS
```</p>
<p>So, to break down each command in the pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tr</code>: filters out all characters except those in the sets A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and <code>_</code></li>
<li><code>head -c 14</code>: displays the first 14 characters of the input from <code>tr</code></li>
<li><code>xargs</code>: adds a nice newline character at the end of the string, so it's easy to copy. </li>
</ul>
<p>This command could be easily adopted to use <code>base64</code> instead of <code>tr</code> without setting <code>LC_ALL=C</code> if you wanted more random characters in the string:</p>
<p><code>base64 &lt; /dev/random | head -c 14 | xargs</code></p>
<p>Expanding <code>head -c</code> to 34 or so makes for a nice password generator. </p>
<p>In fact, I've aliased this to <code>pgen</code> in my <code>.zshrc</code>:</p>
<p><code>pgen()
{
    base64 &lt; /dev/random | head -c 32 | xargs
}</code></p>
<p>There's almost certainly easier ways to generate a random string in the shell, but I like this, and it works for me. </p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Update: The good Dr. Drang suggested ending the pipeline and running <code>echo</code> instead of <code>xargs</code> for clairity, which makes a lot of sense to me. I updated the alias to <code>base64 &lt; /dev/random | head -c 32; echo</code>.</p>

<p>Outside of a miracle, we are about to enter an era of desperation in the generative AI space. We're two years in, and we have no killer apps — no industry-defining products — other than ChatGPT, a product that burns billions of dollars and nobody can really describe. Neither Microsoft, nor Meta, nor Google or Amazon seem to be able to come up with a profitable use case, let alone one their users actually like, nor have any of the people that have raised billions of dollars in venture capital for anything with "AI" taped to the side — and investor interest in AI is cooling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edward Zitron seems to be a rare voice of frustrated reason in the tech industry. He's very critical of AI, and, more and more, I'm thinking rightfully so. OpenAI is spending over $2 to make $1, burning through billions with no path to profitability.</p>
<p>Couple that with the environmental cost of AI (and its just plain awful cousin, crypto currency) and the unreliability of the generated answers, and I'm wondering just where all of this goes in the next year or so.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what's going on over in Cupertino for them to think that <em>any</em> of the recent Apple Intelligence ads they've been running are a good idea. They're cringy at best, and honestly just flat out insulting. </p>
<p>In one a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m0MoYKwVTM">schlub writes an email</a> to his boss and uses AI to make it sound 'more professional', in another a young woman uses it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPe8revsg3k">lie about remembering an acquaintance's name</a>. In another the same young woman again uses it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eJy6QyHaFM">lie about reading an email</a> from a college, to her face, while she's sitting with her. In yet another, <a href="https://blog.blankbaby.com/2024/10/apple-intelligence-smug-and-gross.html">linked to recently by Scott McNulty</a>, a woman uses AI to lie to her husband about getting him something for his birthday. </p>
<p>If this is what Apple thinks their AI is for, I honestly don't know that I want any part of it. </p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2023-10-19-Loading_and_Indexing_SQLite.html'>Loading and Indexing SQLite</a></h2>
<p>What a difference a couple of lines of code can make. </p>
<p>I recognize that databases have always been a weak point for me, so I've been trying to correct that lately. I have a lot of experience with management of the database engines, failover, filesystems, and networking, but too little working with the internals of the databases themselves. Early this morning I decided I didn't know enough about how database indexes worked. So I did some reading, got to the point where I had a good mental model for them, and decided I'd like to do some testing myself. I figured 40 million records was a nice round number, so I used <a href="https://github.com/lucapette/fakedata">fakedata</a> to generate 40 million SQL inserts that looked something like this:</p>
<p><code>INSERT INTO contacts (name,email,country) VALUES ("Milo Morris","pmeissner@test.tienda","Italy");
INSERT INTO contacts (name,email,country) VALUES ("Hosea Burgess","kolage@example.walmart","Dominica");
INSERT INTO contacts (name,email,country) VALUES ("Adaline Frank","shaneIxD@example.talk","Slovenia");</code></p>
<p>I saved this as fakedata.sql and piped it into <code>sqlite3</code> and figured I'd just let it run in the background. After about <em>six hours</em> I realized this was taking a ridiculously long time, and I estimated I'd only loaded about a quarter of the data. I believe that's because SQLite was treating each <code>INSERT</code> as a separate <em>transaction</em>. </p>
<p>A transaction in SQLite is a unit of work. SQLite ensures that the write to the database is Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable, which means that for each of the 40 million lines I was piping into <code>sqlite3</code>, the engine was ensuring that every line was fully committed to the database before moving on to the next line. That's a lot of work for a very, very small amount of data. So, I did some more reading and found one recommendation of explicitly wrapping the entire load into a single transaction, so my file now looked like:</p>
<p>```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;</p>
<p>INSERT INTO contacts (name,email,country) VALUES ("Milo Morris","pmeissner@test.tienda","Italy");
INSERT INTO contacts (name,email,country) VALUES ("Hosea Burgess","kolage@example.walmart","Dominica");
INSERT INTO contacts (name,email,country) VALUES ("Adaline Frank","shaneIxD@example.talk","Slovenia");</p>
<p>COMMIT;
```</p>
<p>I set a timer and ran the import again:</p>
<p><code>➜  var time cat fakedata.sql| sqlite3 test.db
cat fakedata.sql  0.07s user 0.90s system 1% cpu 1:13.66 total
sqlite3 test.db  70.81s user 2.19s system 98% cpu 1:13.79 total</code></p>
<p>So, that went from 6+ hours to about 71 seconds. And I imagine if I did some more optimization (possibly using the Write Ahead Log?) I might be able to get that import faster still. But a little over a minute is good enough for some local curiosity testing. </p>
<h2>Indexes</h2>
<p>So… back to indexes. </p>
<p>Indexing is a way of sorting a number of records on multiple fields. Creating an index on a field in a table creates another data structure that holds the field values and a pointer to the record it relates to. Once the index is created it is sorted. This allows binary searches to be performed on the new data structure. </p>
<p>One good analogy is the index of a physical book. Imagine that a book has ten chapters and each chapter has 100 pages. Now imagine you’d like to find all instances of the word “continuum” in the book. If the book doesn’t have an index, you’d have to read through every page in every chapter to find the word. </p>
<p>However, if the book is already indexed, you can find the word in the alphabetical list, which will then have a pointer to the page numbers where the word can be found. </p>
<p>The downside to the index is that it does take additional space. In the book analogy, while the book itself is 1000 pages, we’d need another ten or so for the index, bringing up the total size to 1010 pages. Same with a database, the additional index data structure requires more space to hold both the original data field being indexed, and a small (4-byte, for example) pointer to the record. </p>
<p>Oh, and the results of creating the index are below. </p>
<p>```
SELECT * from contacts WHERE name is 'Hank Perry';
Run Time: real 2.124 user 1.771679 sys 0.322396</p>
<p>CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS name_index on contacts (name);
Run Time: real 22.129 user 16.048308 sys 2.274184</p>
<p>SELECT * from contacts WHERE name is 'Hank Perry';
Run Time: real 0.003 user 0.001287 sys 0.001598</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>That's a massive improvement. And now I know a little more than I did.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2023-08-14-The_Perfect_ZSH_Config.html'>The Perfect ZSH Config</a></h2>
<p>If you spend all day in the terminal like I do, you come to appreciate it's speed and efficiency. I often find myself in Terminal for mundane tasks like navigating to a folder and opening a file; it's just faster to type where I want to go than it is to click in the Finder, scan the folders for the one I want, double-click that one, scan again… small improvements to the speed of my work build up over time. The speed is increased exponentially with the correct configuration for your shell, in my case, <code>zsh</code>. </p>
<p><code>zsh</code> is powerful and flexible, which means that it can also be intimidating to try to configure yourself. Doubly-so when there are multiple 'frameworks' available that will do the bulk of the configuration for you. I used <a href="https://ohmyz.sh">Oh My Zsh</a> for years, but I recently abandoned it in favor of maintaining my own configuration using only the settings that I need for the perfect configuration for my use.</p>
<p>I've split my configuration into five files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>apple.zsh-theme</code></li>
<li><code>zshenv</code></li>
<li><code>zshrc</code></li>
<li><code>zsh_alias</code></li>
<li><code>zsh_functions</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I have all five files in a <code>dotfiles</code> git repository, pushed to a private Github repository. </p>
<p>The <code>zshenv</code> file is read first by <code>zsh</code> when starting a new shell. It contains a collection of environmental variables I've set, mainly for development. For example:</p>
<p><code>export PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true
export PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE=$HOME/.pip/cache
export VIRTUALENV_DISTRIBUTE=true</code></p>
<p>The next file is <code>zshrc</code>, which contains the main bulk of the configurations. My file is 113 lines, so let's take it a section at a time. </p>
<p><code>source /Users/jonathanbuys/Unix/etc/dotfiles/apple.zsh-theme
source /Users/jonathanbuys/Unix/etc/dotfiles/zsh_alias
source /Users/jonathanbuys/Unix/etc/dotfiles/zsh_functions</code></p>
<p>The first thing I do is source the other three files. The first is my prompt, which is cribbed entirely from Oh My Zsh. It's nothing fancy, but I consider it to be elegant and functional. I don't like the massive multi-line prompts. I find them to be far too distracting for what they are supposed to do. </p>
<p>My prompt looks like this:</p>
<p><code> ~/Unix/etc/dotfiles/ [master*]</code></p>
<p>It gives me my current path, what git branch I've checked out, and if that branch has been modified since the last commit. </p>
<p>The next two files, as their names suggest, contain aliases and functions. I have three functions and 16 aliases. I won't go into each of them here, as they are fairly mundane and only specific for my setup. The three functions are to print the current path of the open Finder window, to use Quicklook to preview a file, and to generate a uuid string. </p>
<p>The next few lines establish some basic settings.</p>
<p>```
autoload -U colors &amp;&amp; colors
autoload -U zmv</p>
<p>setopt AUTO_CD
setopt NOCLOBBER
setopt SHARE_HISTORY
setopt HIST_IGNORE_DUPS
setopt HIST_IGNORE_SPACE
```</p>
<p>The <code>autoload</code> lines setup <code>zsh</code> to use pretty colors, and to enable the extremely useful <code>zmv</code> command for batch file renaming. The interesting parts of the <code>setopt</code> settings are the ones dealing with command history. These three commands allow the sharing of command line history between open windows or tabs. So if I have multiple Terminal windows open, I can browse the history of both from either window. I find myself thinking that the environment is broken if this is not present. </p>
<p>Next, I setup some bindings:</p>
<p>```
  # start typing + [Up-Arrow] - fuzzy find history forward
  bindkey '^[[A' up-line-or-search
  bindkey '^[[B' down-line-or-search</p>
<p># Use option as meta
  bindkey "^[f" forward-word
  bindkey "^[b" backward-word</p>
<p># Use option+backspace to delete words
  x-bash-backward-kill-word(){
      WORDCHARS='' zle backward-kill-word</p>
<p>}
  zle -N x-bash-backward-kill-word
  bindkey '^W' x-bash-backward-kill-word</p>
<p>x-backward-kill-word(){
      WORDCHARS='<em>?_-[]~!#$%^(){}&lt;&gt;|`@#$%^</em>()+:?' zle backward-kill-word
  }
  zle -N x-backward-kill-word
  bindkey '\e^?' x-backward-kill-word</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>These settings let me use the arrow keys to browse history, and to use option + arrow keys to move one word at a time through the current command, or to use option + delete to delete one word at a time. Incredibly useful, use it all the time. Importantly, this also lets me do incremental searching through my command history with the arrow keys. So, if I type <code>aws</code>, then arrow up, I can browse all of my previous commands that start with <code>aws</code>. And when you have to remember commands that have 15 arguments, this is absolutely invaluable. </p>
<p>The next section has to do with autocompletion. </p>
<p>```</p>
<h1>Better autocomplete for file names</h1>
<p>WORDCHARS=''</p>
<p>unsetopt menu_complete   # do not autoselect the first completion entry

<h1>automatically load bash completion functions</h1>
<p>autoload -U +X bashcompinit &amp;&amp; bashcompinit</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>That's a long section, but in a nutshell this lets me type one character, then hit tab, and be offered a menu of all the possible completions of that character. It is case-insensitive, so <code>b</code> would match both <code>boring.txt</code> and <code>Baseball.txt</code>. I can continue to hit tab to cycle through the options, and hit enter when I've found the one I want. </p>
<p>The last section sources a few other files:</p>
<p><code>[ -f ~/.fzf.zsh ] &amp;&amp; source ~/.fzf.zsh
[ -f "/Users/jonathanbuys/.ghcup/env" ] &amp;&amp; source "/Users/jonathanbuys/.ghcup/env" # ghcup-env
[ -s "/Users/jonathanbuys/.bun/_bun" ] &amp;&amp; source "/Users/jonathanbuys/.bun/_bun"
source /Users/jonathanbuys/Unix/src/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
source /Users/jonathanbuys/Unix/src/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh</code> 
If I'm experimenting with Haskell, I'd like to load the <code>ghcup-env</code> variables. If I have <code>bun</code> installed (a way, way faster <code>npm</code>), than use that. The final two sources are for even more enhanced autosuggestions and command line syntax highlighting. So, typos or commands that don't exist will be red, good commands where <code>zsh</code> can find the executable will be green. The autosuggestions take commands from my history and suggest them, I can type right-arrow to accept the suggestion, or keep typing to ignore it. </p>
<p>Taken together, I've been able to remove Oh My Zsh, but keep all of the functionality. My shell configuration is constantly evolving as I find ways to make things faster and more efficient. I don't consider myself a command line zealot, but I do appreciate how this setup gets out of my way and helps me work as fast as I can think.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>p.s. A lot of this configuration was taken from other sources shared around the internet, as well as the <code>zsh</code> documentation. I regret that I haven't kept references to the origins of some of these configs. If I can find the links I'll post them here.</p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2023-01-26-Future_Work_and_AI.html'>Future Work and AI</a></h2>
<p>I've been trying to wrap my small monkey brain around what ChatGPT will mean in the long run. I'm going to try to think this through here. In many ways the advances we've seen in AI this past year perpetuate the automation trend that's existed since… well, since humans started creating technology. I've seen arguments that seem to be on two ends of a spectrum, that the AI is often wrong and unreliable, and we shouldn't use it for anything important, to AI is so good that it's going to put us all out of jobs. As with most truths, I think the reality is somewhere in between. </p>
<p>It's my opinion that jobs that AI can replace, it probably will replace <em>a lot of</em>. But not all. Referring back to our discussion about the current state of Apple news sites, if the site is a content farm pumping out low-value articles for hit counts and views, I can see AI handling that. If your site is well thought out opinions and reviews about things around the Apple ecosystem, that I think will be safe. Because it's the person's opinion that gives the site value. </p>
<p>For more enterprise-y jobs, I could see fewer low and mid-level developers. Fewer managers, fewer secretaries, fewer creatives. Not all gone, but certainly less than before. If your job is to create stock photos and put together slide shows, you might want to expand your skill set a bit. </p>
<p>I think… the kind of jobs that will survive are the type that bring <em>real value</em>. The kind of value that can't be replicated by a computer. Not just the generation of some text or code, but coming up with the <em>why</em>. What needs to be made, and why does it need to be made? </p>
<p>Maybe AI will help free us up to concentrate on solving really hard problems. Poverty, clean water, famine, climate change. Then again, maybe it'll make things worse. I suppose in the end that's up to us.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2022-06-09-GPG_Signing_Git_Commits.html'>GPG Signing Git Commits</a></h2>
<p>On my way towards completing another project I needed to setup <code>gpg</code> public key infrastructure. There are many tutorials and explanations about gpg on the web, so I won't try to explain what it is here. My goal is to simply record how I went about setting it up for myself to securely sign my Git commits. </p>
<p>Most everything here I gathered from <a href="https://dev.to/benjaminblack/signing-git-commits-with-modern-encryption-1koh">this tutorial</a> on <code>dev.to</code>, but since I'm sure I'll never be able to find it again after today, I'm going to document it here. </p>
<p>First, install gpg with Homebrew:</p>
<p><code>brew install gpg</code></p>
<p>Next, generate a new Ed25519 key:</p>
<p><code>gpg --full-generate-key --expert</code></p>
<p>We pick option (9) for the first prompt, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and option (1) for the second, Curve 25519. Pick the defaults for the rest of the prompts, giving the key a descriptive name. </p>
<p>Once finished you should be able to see your key by running:</p>
<p><code>gpg --list-keys --keyid-format short</code></p>
<p>The tutorial recommends using a second subkey generated from the first key to actually do the signing. So, we edit the master key by running:</p>
<p><code>gpg --expert --edit-key XXXXXXX</code></p>
<p>Replacing XXXXX with the ID of your newly generated key. Once in the gpg command line, enter <code>addkey</code>, and again select ECC and Curve 25519 for the options. Finally, enter <code>save</code> to save the key and exit the command line.</p>
<p>Now when we run <code>gpg --list-keys --keyid-format short</code> we should be able to see a second key listed with the designation <code>[S]</code> after it. The ID will look similar to this:</p>
<p><code>sub   ed25519/599D272D 2021-01-02 [S]</code></p>
<p>We will need the part after <code>ed25519/</code>, in this case <code>599D272D</code>. Add that to your global Git configuration file by running:</p>
<p><code>git config --global user.signingkey 599D272D</code></p>
<p>If you'd like <code>git</code> to sign every commit, you can add this to your config file:</p>
<p><code>git config --global commit.gpgsign true</code></p>
<p>Otherwise, pass the <code>-S</code> flag to your <code>git</code> command to sign individual commits. I'd never remember to do that, so I just sign all of them. </p>
<p>Make sure that gpg is unlocked and ready to use by running:</p>
<p><code>echo "test"  | gpg --clearsign</code></p>
<p>If that fails, run <code>export GPG_TTY=$(tty)</code> and try again. You should be prompted to unlock GPG with the passphrase set during creation of the key. Enter the export command in your <code>~/.zshrc</code> to fix this issue.</p>
<p>Finally, Github has a simple way to add gpg keys, but first we'll need to export the public key:</p>
<p><code>gpg --armor --export 599D272D</code></p>
<p>Copy the entire output of that command and enter it into the Github console under Settings, "SSH and GPG keys", and click on "New GPG key". Once that's finished, you should start seeing nice green "Verified" icons next to your commits.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time in the terminal, but I spend an equal amount of time in my text editor. My main requirements for a text editor is that it be equally fast and powerful, but not try to do much more than just be a text editor. I have my terminal a quick command-tab away, so its very easy to jump back and forth, I don't need a terminal built into my text editor. I also need my text editor to be completely accurate. What I see has to be what is written to the file, no "hidden syntax". That's why I prefer BBEdit. BBEdit has powerful text editing features, but it's not overwhelming. It's not trying to be your entire operating system. </p>
<p>In fact, BBEdit fits perfectly in the macOS environment. I used to be a dedicated vim user, but over time the context switching between the different macOS applications and vim became distracting. One of the great things about macOS is that once you learn the basic keyboard combos they apply almost everywhere, unless the application you are using is not a good Mac citizen. Vim has it's own set of keyboard combos, endlessly configurable and expandable. I started forgetting my own shortcuts. BBEdit uses the macOS standard keyboard combos, many inherited from emacs, so if you learn how to navigate text in TextEdit you can apply those same shortcuts to BBEdit. </p>
<p>But, BBEdit is also powerful. You can include custom text snippets for autocompletion, run scripts to manipulate text, and use regular expressions for detailed search and replace operations. With the latest release you can also <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/Setting_up_BBEdit_14's_Python_Language_Server_Protocol/">setup a language server</a> for more powerful syntax checking and completion. BBEdit has been in active development for 30 years, and in that time the developer, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=r2xowjrr">Rich Siegel</a> has continuously improved it and kept it up to date with the ever-changing architectures of macOS. BBEdit feels just as much at home on my M1 MacBook Pro as it did on the Macintosh of the 90's.</p>
<p>BBEdit hits the right balance of power and simplicity for my workflow. It's fast, reliable, and fits perfectly in the Mac environment. For as long as Rich is developing it, BBEdit will be in my Dock. I don't know what will happen when he decides to retire, but I'm hoping that decision is many, many years away.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2022-01-05-My_2022_Mac_Setup.html'>My 2022 Mac Setup</a></h2>
<p>Starting its fifth year on my desk, my <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/jonathan-buys-mac-iphone-setup/">2017 iMac 5k</a> is still going strong, but starting to show it's age. There's still nothing that I can't do with it, but after looking at my wife's M1 MacBook Air I can't help but be just a little jealous of how fast that little machine is. I've yet to come across any computer that offers the same value as the iMac, especially when you factor in how good this 27" retina screen is. I'm tempted by both the <a href="https://www.apple.com/imac-24/">current 24" M1 iMac</a>, and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-14-and-16/">new 16" M1 Max MacBook Pro</a>, but the rumor mill is talking about bigger, master iMacs and <a href="https://medium.com/macoclock/the-2022-m2-macbook-air-11759d5d1d63">colorful M2 MacBook Airs</a>, either of which might actually make the most sense for my desk. I want to see the entire lineup before committing. The good thing is that no matter which machine I choose, it's going to be a major speed improvement from where I am now.</p>
<p>On the software side I'm in a bit of a state of flux. Old standards are now no longer given, but because I've been using them for so long I'm reluctant to step away. Apple's Reminders has gotten <em>good enough</em> for most things, but after a brief experiment over the holidays I found that I was letting things slip through the cracks, and headed back to OmniFocus. <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>, for all its complexity, feels like home. </p>
<p><a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/More_on_1Password/">1Password's upcoming switch to Electron</a> has me concerned, but after some consideration I wonder how much of my concern is practical and how much of it is philosophical. Ideally, I would have preferred if 1P 8 was an evolution of 1P 7, instead of an entirely different application, but at the end of the day I'm still going to use it for work, and I still have a family subscription that I get through my Eero subscription, so I'll keep it around. And if I'm going to have it anyway… why not keep using it? The flip side of that coin is that when using Safari the built-in password manager is seamless, far simpler than 1Password, even for one-time codes. But, do I really want all my passwords only available in Safari? Sometimes I might want to use Firefox. This is all still up in the air. </p>
<p>For file management, I've still got <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink">DEVONthink</a>, but it's another one where I'm not sure I'll keep it. Again, ideally, iCloud Drive would be encrypted end-to-end so I could safely trust that I could put sensitive work data on it and not be putting my career at risk, but that's not the world we live in. Without DEVONthink I need to keep all my files on my local machine, which is normally fine, but every now and then I want to get to something while I'm out running around, and DEVONthink to Go is the only secure solution. I've heard rumors that encryption might be coming, but until it's here I think I'm going to stick with DT.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> and <a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com">Hazel</a> are both on the chopping block. I still have both installed, but neither are running. For Keyboard Maestro, I honestly can't keep extra keyboard shortcuts in my head, and I've never found that many uses for the application. For a long time the only thing I'd use it for is text expansion, and even then only for the date stamp, i.e. <code>2022-01-05_</code>. If there comes a time when iCloud Drive is encrypted, I'll probably turn Hazel back on for automatic file management. But given that everything now gets dumped into DEVONthink, all my files are organized by the apps AI and I have less to set up and maintain. And if I'm honest, I've always had problems with Hazel's pattern matching, sometimes it would inexplicably not match a pattern in a file I could easily find while searching with Spotlight. Most of Keyboard Maestro's automation features that I did use I've moved into Shortcuts. I'm looking forward to <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/A_New_macOS/">Hazel-like functionality being built into macOS</a>.</p>
<p>Other than that, I'm happy with <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a>, I've increased my use of the Apple Notes app quite a bit, I love <a href="https://netnewswire.com">NetNewsWire</a> (although I've decreased the number of sites I'm subscribed to for less, but better, content), <a href="https://www.mindnode.com/?ref=shortcuts.design">MindNode</a> is a fantastic mind-mapping app, and I keep all my mail in Mail. The biggest new addition to my setup is <a href="https://www.parallels.com">Parallels</a> for running Windows 10. I've found I need this for teaching the Microsoft Office course at the local community college. Of course, this is another area where I'm unsure what I'll do when I finally do update to an M-series Mac, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2022-01-03-The_Reminders_Experiment.html'>The Reminders Experiment</a></h2>
<p>Over the past month I've been experimenting with cutting down on the number of applications I use on my Mac. One in particular I though was going to stick was moving my task management system over from OmniFocus to Reminders. I enjoyed the everywhere integration of Reminders, like how Siri would include any tasks I had scheduled for the day when I asked my HomePod "What's my update?". Unfortunately, when I sat down at the end of the holiday break to think about the projects I had going at work, and how to schedule them out for the upcoming week, I realized I needed to open OmniFocus, and once it was open, I knew the experiment was over. </p>
<p>I've been using the GTD system for so long now it's a part of how I think. OmniFocus was built around that system. It's the only to-do app that I'm aware of that does things like defer dates and built-in weekly reviews. It might be a deep and complex app, but I've got it customized to my liking. I know which parts of it I use (perspectives) and which parts I never touch (flagged tasks). </p>
<p>The long and the short of it is that I've got a complicated job as a senior devops engineer, I teach two courses at the local community college at night, I've got a family, and I've got a home and vehicles to take care of. To be able to <em>focus</em>, to <em>be there</em> for my family, for my work, I need a system that I can trust. For me, OmniFocus is the foundation of that system. I'm not excited about the new direction of their mobile app, but I can live with it. I imagine that OmniFocus and I are going to be together for a long time.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2022-01-01-The_Subtle_Art_of_Snowblowing.html'>The Subtle Art of Snowblowing</a></h2>
<p>If you are fortunate enough to live in a home with a driveway, and fortunate enough to live in a region that gets a lot of snow, you are already familiar with the seasonal chore of snowblowing[^1]. It is currently seven degrees Fahrenheit outside, and the weather forecast calls for five to six inches in snow today, which means that soon enough I'll bundle up and head out to take part.</p>
<p>Snowblowing gives me a lot of time to think, and over the years I've developed a system for keeping the driveway in tip-top condition. There are a few rules, or, more likely "best practices", to keep in mind when considering next steps while looking at a fresh blanket of snow. You must keep in mind the current and forecasted weather, your schedule and the schedule of anyone who lives with you, the state of your machinery and current preparation level, and finally the pattern you'll walk when clearing the driveway and sidewalk. Importantly, grab your hot beverage of choice and enjoy the magical beauty of snowfall.</p>
<p>You'll want to wait for the current storm to be over, don't start snowblowing when it's snowing unless you have no choice. Ideally there will be a nice break after the storm. The sky clears and the sun comes out. This is when the city will send out their plows to clear the roads, and it's best if you can wait till after the plows go by to start your driveway. It's maddening when the plow goes by your home and shoves a giant pile of slushy mess at the bottom of your freshly snowblown driveway. If you can wait till they are done, you can get it all done at once. </p>
<p>However, don't wait long! Snow is <em>normally</em> easiest to blow when it is fresh powder. Depending on how much snow fell, and the arrangement of your driveway, you are in danger of the snow melting enough to turn to slush, which is much harder to move. </p>
<p>The number one most important thing to keep in mind is to clear the driveway <em>before anyone drives on it.</em> This is why you need to consider household scheduling. If anyone needs to leave or arrive before you get a chance to snowblow, the weight of the vehicle driving will pack the snow down tight. Once packed down like this, the snowblower will ride right over the tracks, barely scraping the top instead of pushing the snow out. Then, even if you've done a good job with the rest of the driveway, you'll have two hard-packed treads of snow going across it that will (1) look bad, and (2) turn into a slipping hazard. When the sun comes out, and if your driveway gets a full day's worth of direct sunlight, even if it's below freezing, the sun will melt the snow just enough for it to re-freeze and turn to ice. Once this happens it is difficult to get off the driveway, and it's likely those treads will be there for the remainder of the season.</p>
<p>When the time is right to head outside, you'll learn quickly if you are properly prepared. Snowblowing is cold work, start with the right clothes. I've found that wearing a base layer of cold-weather gear helps tremendously, as does choosing the right pants. I try to avoid jeans unless they are flannel-lined, and normally go with a pair of hiking pants from Eddie Bower. These pants provide a layer of protection from the snow melting in, dry quickly, and when paired with the base-layer gear are warm enough. I wear a base layer shirt, a t-shirt, and a flannel, and then an Eddie Bower puffy jacket. I top it off with a North Face winter hat, and a pair of insulated leather work gloves. Of all my cold weather gear, I'm currently most unhappy with the gloves, my fingers tend to start freezing after a half-hour or so outside, so I'll need to replace them with something better soon. Finally, wear thick wool socks if you have them, and good boots. Sneakers will work in a pinch, but I'd double-up on the socks, otherwise your toes will get very cold very quickly. </p>
<p>Next, hopefully you've read the weather and have started up your snowblower once this season, checked the oil, and made sure you've got a full tank along with a spare gallon of gas or two. If you start to snowblow the driveway and run out of gas, or, worse, if you have a bad snowblower that won't start, all the other preparation and scheduling you've done won't matter. Like a Scout, be prepared.</p>
<p>Speaking of snowblowers, my advice for equipment is the same as my advice for computers. Buy the best you can afford. This is not an area to skimp. True, it might be hard to look at it during the other ten months out of the year when it's sitting in your shed or garage taking up space, but you'll be thankful you have it those few times per year you need it. When looking at purchasing equipment, remember the old adage, "Buy nice, or buy twice." You <em>really</em> want that snowblower to start up the first time you pull the cord.</p>
<p>In the same vein, purchase the best snow shovel you can afford. Even though you've got a nice snowblower, you'll need a shovel for detail work, porches, and light snowfalls that don't warrant getting out the powered equipment. Avoid the cheap plastic shovels, and avoid shovels with a weird bend in the handle. What you want is a wide metal shovel with a good blade on the edge and a sturdy, straight handle. That will give you the most control over the shovel and let you get the most work done with it. I've always found the bent handle shovels to be awkward to use. </p>
<p>Once you've found the right weather at the right time, you are properly dressed, and your equipment is prepared and ready, it's time to start blowing snow. The way you go about this is part science and part art. You have to read the wind, the weight of the snow, and the power of your snowblower. You need to keep in mind how you want the driveway to look afterwards. Ideally, you move enough snow off the driveway that it's bare concrete underneath, or close enough to bare that the sun will melt what's left off and leave it clean. You want clean straight lines delineating the edges of your driveway where your lawn starts. If you can't get to clear concrete, you'll want your driveway to have just the barest layer of snow left on it, and have that snow reflect the plow tracks of your snowblower. Again, long straight lines are best. Avoid mixing vertical and horizontal patterns, you'll want the entire driveway to look like it was all done at once.</p>
<p>The pattern you use to clear the driveway will be somewhat dependent on the weather, but I've found that normally starting in the center of the driveway and blowing snow to the left and right of it and working out towards the edges works best. </p>
<p><img src="/media/snowblow-3.png" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>You could start at one edge and work your way all the way over to the other edge. If the wind is strong in one direction crossways this is probably the best bet. </p>
<p><img src="/media/snowblow-2.png" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>You'll need room to turn around, so I've found that one or two paths right at the top of the driveway parallel to the road gives me plenty of room. However, avoid trying to snowblow the entire driveway this way, you'll wind up with a face full of snow, blowing snow all over your freshly blown driveway, and worse, blowing snow into the road. Don't blow snow into the road, that's poor form. </p>
<p><img src="/media/snowblow-1.png" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>Finally, once the driveway is cleared you may be tempted to put salt on it to prevent icing. Don't. Salt will damage your concrete, and stops working after it gets below ten degrees anyway. If icing is a safety issue, it's better to put down a chemical deicing agent. I've seen sand recommended, but I've never seen anyone using it. Overall, it's best to put the work in with the snowblower and shovel to clear all the snow off the driveway before it turns to ice, and let the sun take care of the rest of it. That way you don't have to worry about slipping. </p>
<p>Some see snowblowing as a chore, I see it as a rare opportunity to continue perfecting the craft. In a world where most work happens in front of a screen, it's good to be able to physically accomplish something you can be proud of. And a well cared for driveway, clean and cleared of snow and ice after a storm, is definitely something to be proud of. </p>
<p>[^1]: Apparently "snowblowing" is not a proper English word. I don't care. It should be. It's what I do when I clear my driveway of snow using the snowblower.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2021-12-21-More_on_1Password.html'>More on 1Password</a></h2>
<p>1Password 7 was an incremental improvement on 6, and 6 was an incremental improvement on 5, and so on all the way back to the <a href="https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/OPM2#v2024">original 1Passwd</a>. But 1Password 8, which is <a href="https://releases.1password.com/mac/early-access/#1password-for-mac-8.5.0-57">now in Beta</a> is a horse of a different color.</p>
<p>I've been trying to understand the reasoning behind the change. In a nutshell, AgileBits decided that the Mac wasn’t worth having a dedicated codebase, so they’ve thrown everything out and started over from scratch with Rust and Electron.</p>
<p>Over the past several months I’ve been thinking about how much I care about this, and decided that, for me, there’s a fairly short list of things I care a lot about, and the software I use every day on my Mac is one of them.</p>
<p>Part of what makes a Mac great is the predictability of application behavior. Once a user gains an understanding of the Mac environment, they can reasonably expect to be able to quickly pick up any other application. Things like menu items, keyboard shortcuts, help docs, and how the UI of the application are presented are standardized across the system.</p>
<p>Cross-platform shovelware often doesn’t care about any of that. Instead, they focus on their own UI paradigms, and often miss out on the built-in benefits of native app integration. The 1Password developers Mitchell Cohen and Andrew Beyer said as much in a recent interview on the Changelog Podcast, <a href="https://changelog.com/podcast/468">episode #468</a>, (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You go to a Starbucks, a college campus, you just look at your friends, family and co-workers, and they love their Macs. But you look at the software they’re using, and it’s normal software. It’s cross-platform software, web-based, a lot of times just inside of a web browser… And they don’t really think about it that way. They don’t ask for apps that look like Apple made them in the ‘90s the way that I think a lot of people kind of want us to go back and do that. And regardless of what technology we use, we’re not gonna do that. <em>We’re going to make an app that looks and feels like the experience that we want</em>, just like every other developer effectively is doing in 2021.</p>
<p>I actually think that for the average college student, for instance, who uses a Mac, they’ll think of something like Discord or Slack or Notion and say “That’s what a Mac app looks like. That’s how it works.” They’re not going to point to these apps that came out decades ago, that sort of are the standard bearers for what a native Mac app is supposed to be. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sad, but I don't think I can argue against their point. The <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/03/20/mac-assed-mac-apps">concept of a Mac app</a> is fading, but that doesn't mean we have to like it, or even agree that it's right. </p>
<p>Electron tries to mimic the native AppKit environment, and in some apps it gets pretty close. But Electron is a resource hog, that's the other downside. Slack takes up way more RAM than it should, and Microsoft's Teams makes my MacBook Air’s fans kick in every time I use it.</p>
<p>Electron is what you use when your company goals are more important than building the best application for your users. Honestly, how many Mac users really care about Linux? Well, at least one of the <a href="https://changelog.com/podcast/468#transcript-50">1Password devs does</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But one of the really important goals was we wanted a browser extension that could work without a natively-installed application on the machine. And there’s a lot of reasons for that. One, <em>at the time we had no Linux app, so that was a part of the market where – like, I’ve been using Linux since YellowDog on my original iMac… Whether I’m using Linux now or not, I always wanted 1Password on Linux</em>; and this was a really easy way to make something that would run on Linux immediately.</p>
<p>The other thing is you have this thing called ChromeOS, which is this system – it runs Android apps sometimes, but it’s another place where a lot of things are done on the web, they’re done within Chrome… It’s a great place where you want a web extension or a browser extension that doesn’t need a Mac app running, or something like that. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would argue that even on Linux not having a native experience for Gnome or KDE or whatever they use now is <em>worse</em> than having a cross-platform Electron app that doesn't respect the local desktop environment. But, on Linux, I suppose having anything at all is a glass of ice water in hell.</p>
<p>Inside 1Password even the concept of what constitutes <a href="https://changelog.com/podcast/468#transcript-74">a native Mac app</a> has already become diluted to unrecognizable. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I wanna push back on this idea of native app, because it comes up in every conversation these days… We’ve done a ton of research, a ton of interviews, and to the normal who doesn’t watch this show and isn’t part of our Twitter tech community, a native app is an app that has an icon on your dock, that has keyboard shortcuts, that you can download and install on your computer…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd say that's a <em>very</em> low bar. Surprisingly, the conversation goes back to the Linux desktop experience. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We’re doing things on Linux that no one’s ever done before</em>, for instance having biometrics and browser extension integration, and integration with the system keychain… The Linux community has been really grateful and appreciative of that, and me too, <em>because I love Linux</em>.</p>
<p>It goes on and on, and we’re always going to do that, because the app isn’t very useful if it doesn’t integrate well with your computer.</p>
<p>But the buttons are not NSbutton And that’s where I’m just – I don’t really care anymore. I wanna build a great product, with great features, and I think that’s true for all of us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The developers go into detail about the amount of work they've had to do to make the next version of 1Password feel at least somewhat at home on the Mac, as far as their definition of that goes. What they don't go into detail on is how 1Password will keep up to date on the Mac as those custom details change and start to look and behave not just out of place, but out of date. When the Mac UI changes, Mac apps that have integrated with the native AppKit framework inherit the new look and functionality mostly "for free". The work that AgileBits is putting into reimplementing AppKit functionality is going to have to be maintained and updated constantly.</p>
<p>Seems to me that they could have saved themselves the work and updated their existing 1Password 7 codebase, but only AgileBits knows for sure. </p>
<p>To be fair, Apple isn't helping themselves much here. Pushing out their own apps that don't adhere to their own HIG only encourages third-party developers to continue to use UI paradigms and design languages created for themselves, not the user.</p>
<p>I think 1Password 8's release will mark the start of a sad chapter in the state of the Mac. Paradoxically, it comes at a time when the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/12/apple-mac-shipments-grew-more-than-110-year-over-year-in-q1-2021">Mac has never been stronger</a>, when the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/11/16-inch_macbook_pro_first_impressions">hardware has never been better</a>, and when Apple is at the <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/10/apple-announces-record-fourth-quarter/">top of their game</a>. Even with all that being true, the actual user experience of using a Mac with popular third-party software is going to be worse in 2022 than it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060615173608/http://1passwd.com">in 2006</a>.</p>

<p>But even on the desktop apps and mobile apps, we had web views, we had web-based integrations. And in fact, the most important part of our desktop app, which people interact with every day, has always been web-based and very heavily so. And that of course is the browser extension.</p>
<p>[16:16] So it’s interesting to see people think of what we’re doing as sort of like a move, or a shift, when really it’s just taking something we’ve always cared about deeply and continuing to use it in our product for the things that appeal to us about it.</p>

<p>We wanted to make sure that we were building a product that was modern and discoverable in this day and age. And we had a lot of problems there, whether you were on a Mac and switched to Windows; at the time we didn’t even have a Linux client… There were parts of 1Password that felt, looked and acted differently. And a lot of that is because of our origin story. We had two founders that started this company over 15 years ago, they built the first Mac app, and essentially built the company from the ground up that way… And when the time came to add Windows, they just hired someone to write a Windows app. They joined the company, started building up a small team; same for Android, started with one person…</p>

<p>I’m not 100% – I’m still waiting to see, is there another Electron app that does unlocking with Apple Watch? We might be the only one; I haven’t found another one. But <em>we spent a heck of a lot of effort into the actually making our Mac app as good in 1Password 8 as 1Password 7</em>. </p>
<p>One of the things you brought up was the permissions dialogue not being in a separate window; we actually at one point had the app do that. That is something you can absolutely do; that’s not an Electron feature, or a problem with Electron that prevents you from having multiple windows. <em>We made a conscious design choice to bring the 1Password design language into these new apps</em>.</p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2021-08-12-For_the_Future.html'>For the Future</a></h2>
<p>It's been a busy couple weeks in the Mac community. From horrendously serious topics like Apple taking on child sexual abuse material (CSAM) by scanning photos uploaded to iCloud to drastically less serious topics like an upcoming OmniFocus redesign and 1Password switching to Electron. But first, a follow up to <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/Switcher_Season_2021/">Switcher Season 2021</a>.</p>
<p>After seriously considering my motivations I've come to the decision to stick with the Mac and my Apple gear for the foreseeable future. It would be a massive and expensive effort to replace everything, even piecemealing it one bit at a time, and it would disrupt my life and my families lives. Like I said before, when Apple's devices work as advertised it's like pulling a bit of the future down into the present. And that's what I want, I want to live in that optimistic, solarpunk future. Apple has, so far, done well with their green initiatives, like building Macs out of recycled iPhones, and running all their data centers off of renewable energy. Apple is massive now, but at their core I think they still want to do the right thing. Not that they always get it right, or that they always wind up on the right side of a debate, but over all I think I can still support the company because they are still, in general, working towards being a force for good in the world. We need more of that. </p>
<p>Of course, being one of the biggest companies in the world comes with additional scrutiny and responsibility. One of those is doing their part to stop the spread of CSAM, while at the same time protecting the privacy of their customers. I won't get into it too much here, other than to say I think they could do more and it'd be fine. Otherwise I'll just point you to John Gruber's <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/08/apple_child_safety_initiatives_slippery_slope">excellent take</a> on the matter. Also, if this is a necessary step to end-to-end encryption for iCloud Documents, I'm all for it.</p>
<p>On a much, <em>much</em> lighter note, I've been using the new OmniFocus for iOS beta, and while it's not nearly as bad as what's going on with 1Password I'm not sure I'll be upgrading. After using the beta for a while now, I can’t imagine I’ll stick with OmniFocus if they don’t make some significant changes to the UI before they ship. Which is sad, because I’ve been an OmniFocus user for a long time. I suppose I could see how long I can stick with v3, but it probably won’t be long.</p>
<p>I really miss the main dashboard screen, and how large the touch targets are in v3. In v4 I find the outline to be a big step back in usability and just how pleasant the application is to use. The checkboxes are too small, they are on the wrong side, the Forecast view doesn’t have the week calendar at the top, and I can’t swipe to go back to the dashboard. Instead I’ve got to find that little outline button on the bottom left, or just know that you can tap on the name of the perspective. </p>
<p>Some folks might really love how this works, but it’s not for me. The Omni group is using SwiftUI to build a single cross-platform application, and I suppose we should just be grateful they aren't switching to Electron.</p>
<p>Because that's exactly what 1Password is doing. I registered for 1Password Early Access and downloaded the new version and it's like it was built by an entirely different company. <code>⌘ \</code> is no longer the default keyboard shortcut, which is crazy because <a href="/media/1pass-tshirt.jpeg">they had t-shirts made for it</a>. </p>
<p>I've been a supporter and advocate for 1Password for years. I led my team to use it at work in 2016 because I'd been using it and loving it since it was 1Passwd. It's a web app in a frame. v7 was a best in class, completely solid Mac experience. v8 I wouldn't give a second thought to if I wasn't already so invested in the app. I know the AgileBits team gave this a lot of thought, but my opinion is that this is a mistake.</p>
<p>Man, AgileBits used to be such a great little indie Mac company, till they tasted that sweet, sweet <em>enterprise</em> money, then they took millions in investment funding.</p>
<p>One of the founders <a href="https://1password.community/discussion/comment/607171/#Comment_607171">made a good argument</a> for why they eventually decided to go this route:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@shepstl There is a bit of a truth here. I think the business/enterprise side is important for us.</p>
<p>You can see over that over the past few years every major vendor — Google, Apple, Microsoft have built their own password manager. Once something becomes essential, there will be a free option. Remember when Netscape used to sell the web browser and now it is something that we all expect to be free?</p>
<p>If we want to survive, we have to provide something more. Support for businesses (and families!) is a big part of it.</p>
<p>Now, both Dave and I are still using 1Password everyday. We are Mac users and we want to have the best experience for ourselves.</p>
<p>We agonized over the Electron choice and how it will be received by the community. Yesterday wasn't easy and some of the feedback did hit our team pretty hard. I still think/hope we could pull it off and people will come around 🤞 I know I did — while there is still work that needs to be done, I can't imagine using the old app today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand. I don't agree, but I understand. I think they could have continued to ship a first-class native citizen on each platform without resorting to Electron, but that's the choice they made. </p>
<p>So where does this leave me?  The thing is, all of these changes are happening at a time when Apple is also making pointed improvements to their native apps. Reminders is getting pretty good in the next version, it'll support tags and smart lists that I could configure to be similar to Perspectives in OmniFocus. There's also enhancements to the built-in password manager in Safari, most notably support for MFA, that make it an attractive native option. It won't be nearly as full-featured as 1Password, just like Reminders will never be OmniFocus, but for my personal use case, maybe 80% is <em>good enough</em>. That, and Reminders deep integration into the Apple ecosystem will probably be what it takes for me to move. </p>
<p>I'm always looking for ways to simplify, reduce. To use less and do more. OmniFocus and 1Password are just reminding me to take a close look and see if I really need them in my life or not. I'm suspecting in the next couple of months I'll wind up with not.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2021-08-08-Switcher_Season_2021.html'>Switcher Season 2021</a></h2>
<p><img alt="system76-thelio" src="/media/system76-thelio.png" /></p>
<p>Years ago Alex Payne wrote "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201109035455/https://al3x.net/blog/2009/08/10/switching-season">Switching Season</a>", about how he thought about switching from Mac to Linux. I know how he feels. From time to time I get the idea in my head that I'd like to move away from all things Apple and diversify my investment in technology. This normally manifests itself when I'm in the market for a new computer (which I am), and often in the form of a Unix workstation on my desk. The past few days I've been eyeing the <a href="https://system76.com/desktops">System 76 Thelio</a>.</p>
<p>To be accurate, this is not a "Unix" workstation, since it ships running a weird version of Ubuntu Linux. I wouldn't run Linux on it though, I'd run a minimal install of <a href="https://freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> combined with the <a href="https://xmonad.org">XMonad tiling window manager</a>. Inside XMonad I'd have half the screen taken up by Firefox, and the other half be a terminal, most likely split with <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a>. I could keep Vim handy for running <a href="https://vimwiki.github.io">Vimwiki</a> and all my other text editing needs, play music in <a href="https://cmus.github.io">cmus</a>, keep up to date with the news with <a href="https://newsboat.org">newsboat</a>, and handle email with <a href="http://www.mutt.org">mutt</a>.</p>
<p>When I did need Linux or Windows for whatever reason, I'd keep a virtual machine image handy to <a href="https://www.ateamsystems.com/tech-blog/howto-windows-10-bhyve-w-freebsd-11/">spin up in bhyve</a>.</p>
<p>It could be a quiet, extremely focused work environment. Zero alerts, no notifications, no extraneous applications to pull me away from what I'm doing. </p>
<p>But… I'd also be closing the door on some future possibilities. I've been working on a new Mac app for bookmarking lately, and it's actually very close to being ready for the App Store. A few things left undone yet, and it's a little buggy in places, but overall it's getting close. With my focused Unix workstation I'd be saying to myself "this part of your life is over." And, that's hard to say because the Mac and I go way back.</p>
<p>Apple was on the rebound when I bought my first Mac in 2003 or so, but I'd been eyeing them for years from overseas. Very similar to how I've been eyeing the System76 box, come to think of it. They were on the rebound, but they still weren't anything close to what they are now. They were still the scrappy underdog, not literally the world's most valuable company. The community around the Mac was a lot of fun, we kept getting blown away by the amazing technology that came out of Cupertino. </p>
<p>Following Apple as a hobby has been a spark of joy for many years. The thing is though, as they've grown and focused more on services and integrating themselves deeper and deeper into my everyday life, I've stared to feel a little uncomfortable. Like maybe I'm not completely ok with the world's biggest company being my desktop computer, my laptop computer, my phone, my watch, my tv box, my workout companion, my cloud storage, my email, my music, my photos, my headphones, my speakers. So much.</p>
<p>There's still enough rebel in me that wants to root for the underdog. The little guy trying to do the right thing. System76 ticks the right boxes for me. Aesthetically pleasing design, small company, manufacturing in the US. If I were to do this, I'd eventually want to wean myself off the rest of the Apple ecosystem. Replace my Apple Watch with a <a href="https://explore.garmin.com/en-US/forerunner/">Garmin Forerunner</a>. Replace my iPhone with a <a href="https://www.thelightphone.com">Light Phone II</a> and a <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-clara-hd">Kobo ereader</a>. Replace the Apple TVs with <a href="https://www.roku.com">Rokus</a>. Replace my HomePods with a couple more <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home">Sonos speakers</a>. It'd be a long process. </p>
<p>And honestly, it's a process that I'm not sure I'm up for. Especially when living in the Apple ecosystem is <em>so good</em>. There are tangible benefits from living inside Apple's walled garden, and when it all works together it really feels like living in the future. And that's when I love it all again. Despite Apple's many faults, there's still just nothing better out there. </p>
<p>The System76 box would be super cool, but I'd be stuck on the Intel platform while Apple speeds ahead with the M1. I'd have to abandon any biometric authentication and go back to typing my password for everything. What I think I'd miss the most though is the trackpad. I've had a Magic Trackpad for a few years now and I can't imagine going back to a mouse. Multitouch is a revelation on any platform its used on, and the Mac is no different. It's good for RSI issues, it's amazing for gestures, and I love being able to long-click on words to get their definition. Of course, with an XMonad setup I wouldn't be using the mouse much, but I'd still need it for navigating the web and the odd task in the window environment. </p>
<p>I don't want my choice of computer to be making some kind of weird political or lifestyle statement, but then again, when you vote with your wallet what else can it be? I wish Apple had never become the behemoth that it is today, but it still makes the best computers. </p>
<p>Maybe I'm talking myself into that workstation, maybe I'm talking myself out of it. I honestly haven't decided yet.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2021-07-20-Setting_up_BBEdit_14's_Python_Language_Server_Protocol.html'>Setting up BBEdit 14's Python Language Server Protocol</a></h2>
<p>Bare Bones released the <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/bbedit14.html">new version of BBEdit</a> recently and it's packed with features that teach the old dog some modern IDE tricks. When programming I mainly work in Python these days, so I obviously wanted to take advantage of BBEdit's new <a href="http://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/lsp-notes.html">Langage Server Protocol</a> support. This lets BBEdit start a daemon for you in the background that you install separately, and the daemon takes care of things like code completion, error highlighting, and documentation. However, how to set this up specifically for Python development was a bit unclear to me. Here's how I got it working.</p>
<p>First, and you've probably already got this setup, install <code>python3</code> with <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> and use it to install a virtual environment.</p>
<p><code>brew install python3
python3 -m venv ~/Unix/env/lsp</code></p>
<p>Next, activate the new virtual environment and install the <a href="https://github.com/pappasam/jedi-language-server">Jedi Language Server</a>. Once installed, copy the full path to the executable:</p>
<p><code>source ~/Unix/env/lsp/bin/activate 
pip install -U jedi-language-server
which jedi-language-server | pbcopy</code></p>
<p>Finally, open the preferences for BBEdit, find the Languages section, and towards the botton add a Language-specific setting for Python. Under the Server tab, make sure you've checked the box to "Enable language server", and paste the path copied from the previous command.</p>
<p><img alt="bbedit-python-lsp-prefs" src="/media/bbedit-python-lsp-prefs.png" /></p>
<p>If BBEdit finds the executable at the path, there will be a green dot at the bottom labeled "Ready to start server". Otherwise, you'll see a red dot that says "absolute command path not found". If you see that make sure the commands above completed successfully. </p>
<p>Now, whenever you open a Python file BBEdit will automatically start the LSP daemon in the background and start working it's magic.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2021-07-14-MacSparky_and_DEVONthink.html'>MacSparky and DEVONthink</a></h2>
<p>Yesterday I had the pleasure of chatting with <a href="https://macsparky.com">David Sparks</a> about an upcoming Field Guide he's doing on DEVONthink. He had asked for power users of the app, and given that I've been going back and forth with it for years I sent him a screenshot and let him know I'd be happy to help. He responded and here we are. If you've ever listened to David on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/people/Davidsparks">one of his podcasts</a>, he's just as personable and friendly speaking with him one on one. </p>
<p><img src="/media/devonthink-screenshot-2021.png" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>I'm looking forward to the new Field Guide. My part in it will be as a kind of power user addendum where a few existing users give a glimpse into what their setup looks like. I hope David can get something useful out of my rambling, overall I felt like I barely scratched the surface of what I wanted to say about DEVONthink. I didn't get into the custom CSS for Markdown display, or the Sorter menu extra, or how you can import a webpage from Safari as Markdown and strip all the adds and other junk out of it. I didn't get into backup and restores of the databases, or my Take Note hotkey (^space), or how I integrate RSS into my research database to stay on top of new developments in AWS. Ah well, there's only so much you can do in 15-20 minutes. I'm sure David already covered all of this in his Field Guide anyway.</p>
<p>Also, since DEVONthink is <em>so</em> good at search and discovering additional data, I closed all but my research database during the recording so I didn't accidentally surface any proprietary or personal information. One of the biggest reasons I use DEVONthink is because it can keep all my personal data private and secure between machines, but that wouldn't do much good if I just showed the world my bank account numbers or details about our AWS environment in a search result. </p>
<p>Hopefully David can work some magic in editing. If I'm honest I'm a little nervous about how my section is going to turn out, or if it'll be included at all. Overall though, I think I'll be in good company, and that the Field Guide is going to be a great success. I've got a lot more to say, maybe I should revisit that podcast idea I've had for a while.  No matter how my part tuns out, it was great to talk to someone who's work I've been following online for years. David's work with OmniFocus and Paperless have been foundational, and I hope he has the same success with DEVONthink in the upcoming months.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2021-07-09-Inner-Document_Markdown_Reference_Links.html'>Inner-Document Markdown Reference Links</a></h2>
<p>I'm writing a fairly large document for internal use at work, and instead of using something like Word I've generated a bunch of markdown files that I'm stringing together with the excellent <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> to generate a very nice PDF file with LaTeX. The resulting PDF is beautifully formatted, thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template">Eisvogel template</a>. A key part of the PDF is a functional table of contents outline in the sidebar of Preview, and the ability to link to different parts of the PDF from arbitrary text. </p>
<p>Pandoc generates header identifiers for each section of the document automatically, which you can use as normal markdown-formatted links. The documentation states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A header without an explicitly specified identifier will be automatically assigned a unique identifier based on the header text. To derive the identifier from the header text,</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove all formatting, links, etc.</li>
<li>Remove all footnotes.</li>
<li>Remove all punctuation, except underscores, hyphens, and periods.</li>
<li>Replace all spaces and newlines with hyphens.</li>
<li>Convert all alphabetic characters to lowercase.</li>
<li>Remove everything up to the first letter (identifiers may not begin with a number or punctuation mark).
If nothing is left after this, use the identifier section.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the header <code>Header identifiers in HTML</code> becomes <code>#header-identifiers-in-html</code>. I did this manually exactly once before I was certain that it was going to be far too tedius and something that could be easily solved by <code>awk</code>, or so I thought.</p>
<p>It turns out that the BSD version of <code>awk</code> included with macOS doesn't support the flag needed to convert to lowercase, so instead I grabbed a quick perl command and sandwiched it between two <code>awk</code> commands:</p>
<p><code>sed s/\ /-/g | perl -p -e 'tr/A-Z/a-z/' | sed s/^/\#/g</code></p>
<p>Then all I needed to do was drop that in a file with a shebang header and mark it executable, move the file into BBEdit's "Text Filters" folder and it was made available to BBEdit from the Text menu. Now I just highlight some text I want to format as a link, and select the menu option. </p>
<p>I suppose I could get even fancier and muck with the clipboard, and work all the other Pandoc rules into the script, but I imagine this will take care of %95 of my use cases for what I'm doing. That's more than enough.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2021-01-25-resurrected_site.html'>Resurrected Site</a></h2>
<p>Late last month the domain for this site expired. I had plenty of warning, ample time to log into the Hover dashboard and renew it myself. I could have even left the auto-renew on, like I have  for the past twelve years, but this year was different. This year was the end of 2020, and at the time I felt I had enough of the internet. It was time to log off, possibly forever. </p>
<p>The internet had become a toxic place for me, full of political arguments and outrage, it felt like every time I logged on I was watching everything burn around me, and I didn't want to be a part of it anymore. I left Facebook years ago, I left Twitter in 2020, and I was using my blog to rant about political issues, which was never the intention of this site. This site is here for me to practice writing, to share what I've learned, and to force me to think things through[^1]. It's a repository of my thoughts on the tech industry over time, and a reflection of where I've been in my career and mindset. </p>
<p>I didn't want this site to be something that I knew would start arguments with people I love. My wife and I both got COVID-19 about this same time. There was a lot going on. I let it go. </p>
<p>But then… January 20th rolled around, and 2021 officially started, and with the new year I suddenly felt lighter, more optimistic about the future. I started thinking about sharing tidbits I've learned, and I started thinking about the work I've put into this site over the years. I remembered how much I enjoyed "blogging" as a hobby, when it was a hobby.</p>
<p>I'm seeing the world with fresh eyes this new year, and I hope you are too. There's certainly a lot to look forward to, especially as a Mac user. New rumors about M1 MacBook Pros, iMacs, and possibly even the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2005/10/1676/">elusive xMac</a> finally making an appearance all have me thinking this might have to be an upgrade year. </p>
<p>I'm also picking up a couple of new hobbies this year. I bought myself an entry-level mountain bike that's a big step up from the old Walmart special I've had for almost a decade. I'm looking forward to exploring the trails around central Iowa. I'm also waiting for a telescope to be delivered. I've got an iPhone mount for it, and I'm hoping to be able to do some very, very basic astrophotography. I'll post what I learn as I go. </p>
<p>They say that getting old means that your sense of time gets warped, one day merges into the next into the next. The days all start to look the same as months turn into years. The fight against that is to never stop learning, to never stop exploring. Novelty is what fights old age, it's having things worth remembering. </p>
<p>What do you say we make 2021 <em>worth remembering</em>? </p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2020-12-18-Student_Advice.html'>Student Advice</a></h2>
<p>A student asked me for advice for what to focus on getting into the compsci field. Here's what I said.</p>
<p>I have two pieces of advice:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Stay curious</em>. If you come across something you don’t understand, keep digging till you do. </li>
<li><em>Start building</em>. The best way to learn is to do. Build a web page, build an app, build a server… whatever direction you want to go, pick a project and start digging in. As you go you’ll hit obstacles, you’ll find things that you don’t understand, when you find yourself there, remember number one and keep at it till you’ve figured it out. Honestly that’s how I’ve built my entire career. </li>
</ol>
<p>My personal bias is to recommend the devops path, and the first step on that path is to learn Unix. You can download Linux (a Unix clone) for free, or if you have a Mac can pop open the Terminal app and go to town. Figure out what the shell is, what common commands are available to you, and start writing out a personal library of scripts.</p>
<p>Unix is everywhere, it took over the world and no one even noticed. Unix is the core of macOS, iOS, Android, ChromeBooks, and every server running in the cloud. It’s in Internet of Things devices, it’s in your smartTV, it’s probably in your routers and cable modems, and if you do a search for “Unix or Linux Sysadmin” or “devops engineer” you’ll come up with thousands of available jobs. </p>
<p>Here’s an easy trick to get on the path to knowing your computer, once you are in a Unix or Linux environment, run “ls /bin”, that will show you some of the basic programs available to you, pick one, say, “dd”, and run “man dd” and read the manual page on the command. Keep going till you know what every program in the list does.  </p>
<p>Secondly, and very closely related to learning Unix is learn <em>networking</em>. Learn the TCP/IP stack, the three-way handshake, basic subnetting, Literally everything is networked, so a solid understanding of how it all works can only help. It’s all just signals down a wire. </p>
<p>On a more practical level, I recommend opening up a <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github account</a>, buying a domain name, and using Github to host a webpage with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Use that webpage to write about what you learn. Share your projects. Even the experience of getting the Jekyll site up and running is a good exercise. It’s complicated to get started, but once you figure it out, you’ll have a good base for how a lot of things work in industry. </p>
<p>The combination of doing, then writing, helps with your learning, and it gives back to the community for the next person who wants to learn. Come to think of it, I haven’t done enough of that myself lately. </p>
<p>As far as sites to read… well, you could follow Hacker News  although I don’t. I know quite a few folks who do. I prefer to follow individual blogs <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">like cks</a>. The tech industry was built, originally, by academics and interested folks building and sharing what they’ve learned, and… well, at it’s core it still works that way now. </p>
<p>I hope it's good advice, and I wish the student luck on the path to their new career.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2020-11-09-Healthy_Tech.html'>Healthy Tech</a></h2>
<p>I deleted my twitter account this morning. I've been on Twitter long enough to remember when it was spelled twttr, and there was a SMS bridge to a specific number, 40404 if I remember correctly. For me, it's always been a fun place to chat about Apple and technology. Twitter was a place to learn about new tech and be part of the community of developers, designers, and enthusiasts. Through Twitter I've found apps I use every day, books that I love, Authors to follow. We've chatted live through Apple keynotes, commiserated through hard times, and found common interests across the world. But… that's just not what Twitter is anymore. At least not to me. </p>
<p>I quit Facebook a few years ago because I was using to to get into Political arguments. Today I quit Twitter for the same reason. The old Twitter I loved is still there, but it's buried under the weight of supporting modern society. Politics makes my blood boil, the hypocrisy, the mindless parroting… it's not good for me to be involved in, and I find that it takes only the slightest provocation to lash out and start an argument. Of course, in my mind at the time, I'm trying to prove a point, I'm <em>debating</em>, but that's not the truth. The truth is that it doesn't take much for me anymore to want to argue, and that's just not healthy. </p>
<p>A friend suggested I watch <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com">The Social Dillema</a> on Netflix. I initially resisted because I figured that I've been in the tech industry for so long I know what the AI is doing. I think more people should watch the show, but I didn't think I'd learn anything I didn't already know. But, having the day off today and nothing better to do, I watched it anyway, and I'm glad I did. There was nothing too revelatory in the show, but while watching it I did begin to second guess my participation in any platform that contributed to the decline in mental health and societal structure, and also contributing to a rise in depression, self-harm, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db362.htm">suicide</a>. This is horrifying.</p>
<p>The crux of The Social Dillema is that technology has moved faster than our brains have had time to adapt, not to mention our societal norms and laws. We've gone from having to be physically together to socialize to socializing through a screen in a single generation, and now we are starting to see the effects. For me, I'm taking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames">War Games</a> approach… sometimes the only way to win is not to play. </p>
<p>That's not to say that I'm abandoning technology altogether. I still believe that humans can and will solve the biggest problems we face through technology. Climate change, overpopulation, pandemics, food and water shortages can all be overcome through technology. I believe in a future where clean energy powers our vehicles, green cities provide healthy and sustainable living communities, where we've reversed the effects of climate change, and where, through the building of this future, everyone has meaningful employment. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I believe in personal technology that works <em>for</em> you, where your privacy is paramount, and the systems we choose to use respect our time and mental health. So far I think Apple is doing a good job of helping to build this future, showing the path forward to a sustainable business model that prioritizes privacy over advertising. They could be doing more, but I think they are doing better than the other big players in the industry. </p>
<p>When I pick up my phone I want to know that I'm not going to get lost in an endless feed, that I'm not going to wind up arguing with a stranger, or worse, a friend. I don't want to feel left out, insufficient, or incomplete. I want my technology to help me feel more on top of things, to help me make better choices, to eat better, sleep better, get more exersize, be more productive at work, and remember things for me that I might otherwise forget. I want technology to help me learn new skills, and help me hone old ones. To be the bicycle for the mind. </p>
<p>The answer to the dillema is not to abandone technology… the genie is out of the bottle there. The answer is to be mindful about how we use technology, and to demand better from the developers building these services and devices. </p>
<p>I'm an optimist. I believe we can have healthy relationships with our technology, and I believe that we can overcome the hardest problems our society faces. To do so we must understand the problems, generate in ourselves the desire to overcome them, and then start working together.</p>

<p>It’s been quiet here at home lately. Grey and overcast, rain morning, noon, and night. A good time to rest and recover from a lot of busy weeks. I’m essentially an introvert, and while I enjoy visiting it tends to take a lot out of me. I’ve always preferred long conversations over coffee to loud concerts or clubs. I’m on the couch this morning, my wife's dog is next to me. The dog kept us up a lot last night. It’s nearly silent, but for the breath of the dog and the clack of the keys.</p>
<p>I watched "Amazing Stories” on TV the other day, the one about a guy who went back in time to 1919. While he spent most of the show trying to get back to 2019, he found that he actually preferred life 100 years ago and wound up staying. It’s an interesting thought experiment to consider the things that we’ve gained over the past century, like civil rights, women’s rights, advances in medicine, heating and cooling, the ability to stay in touch over long distances, but also to think about the things that we’ve lost along the way too. Independence, civility,  an overall slower pace of life. I live in a small town and I think a lot about what could revitalize it. Folks that lived here for a long time say that it used to be different, the buildings that are crumbling and empty around the square used to be stores that were stocked and full, kept in top shape. A person could walk down to the square and see their neighbors going about their business. </p>
<p>The butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker.</p>
<p>What I miss is the opportunity for someone to open a shop selling what they’ve made with their own hands, and be able to make a living off of it. People in town say that things changed when the state put in a highway that bypassed the town, but I think that was only a symptom… a sign that pointed to a real cause. Things fell apart because people stopped shopping in the town. They stopped shopping in town because they could get things cheaper if they drove 20 miles to shop at Walmart instead. The desire for cheap goods has decimated small towns and small businesses, making us dependent on massive corporations that exploit the world’s poorest and most vulnerable to make a $5 t-shirt. </p>
<p>What I wouldn’t give for a generation of makers and independents to turn this around. Sometimes I like to write or envision future scenarios where that’s taken place. Not that there’s not a place for big companies. Something like the MacBook or iPhone simply can’t be created by a mom &amp; pop shop, but they could definitely be made here, by us. </p>
<p>We still have a fantastic barber and a, well, mediocre doctors office in town. Although, of course, the doctors office just recently stopped being independent and is now part of a regional system. Now when I call to make an appointment I get re-routed to someone 25 miles away instead of a mile down the road. I was in the office one day when an elderly gentleman was waiting in line right in front of me, and I asked him about how things had changed over the years. He didn’t have much time to talk but the description he gave was striking. I asked him what happened and as he was walking out the door he turned and said “everything got big, big, big!”</p>
<p>I don’t want to go back in time to 1919, I rather enjoy the privileges and comforts that we have now (especially considering that the idealized past so many think about was generally only great if you were white and male), although I also believe that a lot more of us could benefit from living more of Teddy Roosevelt’s “Strenuous Life”. I want to go forward. I want to live in the future where we’ve figured out these things. Where we’ve created self-sustaining communities of independent makers, linked by high-speed rail systems and electric cars powered by the wind and the sun. Where we all grow gardens full of good food, and we know where the goods we buy come from, and maybe even know who made them. Where we know our neighbors. Where we know the mailman’s name and recognize his uniform and know approximately when to expect him. Where teachers are revered for the responsibility they have. Where the ability to fix a broken thing is given the respect it deserves. </p>
<p>I wish I knew how to make that vision a reality, and now in this isolated time  of the Coronavirus, it seems more relevant than ever. We spent too many years getting big, what we need now is to get small again.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2020-03-21-Cloud_Backup_with_Arq_and_B2.html'>Cloud Backup with Arq and B2</a></h2>
<p>I'm a fan of the three-pronged approach to backups. I've got two different drives attached to my iMac, one for Time Machine for hourly backups, and the other for SuperDuper! for nightly clones of the internal drive. For many years I've also had BackBlaze running for a third off-site backup in case the house goes up in flames. At $6 per month it wasn't bad, but at the beginning of the year when I did a review of subscriptions and decided what should stay, it didn't make the cut. Not having an off-site backup bothered me though, and I considered starting it back up again till I heard <a href="https://atp.fm/episodes/368">the guys on ATP</a> talking about <a href="https://www.arqbackup.com">Arq</a> and thought I'd give it a shot. </p>
<p>What I like most about Arq is that it's a standard Mac-assed Mac app. It fits in with the rest Mac environment, is light on resources, and just works as expected. The developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/reitshamer">Stefan Reitshamer</a>, has been working on it since 2009 and has built a good business around it, releasing a Windows version and their own cloud backup option. </p>
<p>At $50 Arq itself is a bit pricy, but by pairing it with Backblaze's own B2 online storage I'm only paying around $1 per month for the storage. Compared with the normal Backblaze service price of $6 per month, I'll have recouped my money after five months of using Arq. My personal dataset that I'm backing up isn't that big, but it is important. </p>
<p>I like having more control over my backups, and knowing that if I add something to the Arq backup set that it'll stay there, no matter if I disconnect a drive or if the data is deleted from my Mac. More control means that there's more setup than Backblaze or Crashplan, but that's a tradeoff I'm willing to live with.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2020-03-19-Over_the_Air.html'>Over the Air</a></h2>
<p>I recently dropped our cable service and switched our home entertainment system to be centered around the Apple TV (the box, not the service), with an app installed to watch live news, sports, and other local channels. Here's how I did it.</p>
<p>I used the otadtv.com <a href="https://otadtv.com/tvtower/index.html">tower locator</a> to find that there were several over-the-air broadcast antennas within 30 miles of us. Since we live in Iowa and the terrain is almost entirely flat farmland, there's very little to get in the way of a signal.</p>
<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
<li>RCA Outdoor Yagi Satellite HD Antenna - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Antenna-Satellite-Broadcast-Epicenter-Reception/dp/B0024R4B5C">link</a></li>
<li>Tablo Dual Lite OTA DVR - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078YKTWV6?tag=techhivecom-20&amp;th=1&amp;ascsubtag=US-003-3173175-005-1442813-web-20">link</a></li>
<li>Seagate Portable 1TB External Hard Drive - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Portable-External-Hard-Drive/dp/B07CRG7BBH/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=usb+hard+drive&amp;qid=1577480306&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-3">link</a></li>
<li>Apple TV HD - <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-tv/apple-tv-hd/32gb">link</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The RCA antenna is inexpensive, and mounted cleanly on the post on my roof recently vacated by the old Dish antenna we haven't used in years. The one downside to the antenna is that the converter that screws into the antennas dipole was incredibly fragile, I accidentally snapped off both ends screwing them on by trying to screw them on too tight. Luckily the part is only $2-$4 at any local hardware store, so I bought two and kept one in a cabinet just in case. </p>
<p>The Tablo box is a DVR that hooks straight into the coax coming from the antenna. It then hooks into the local network either by ethernet, which I do, or over the wireless network. Since the box was going to be sitting right next to my modem and Eero router, it made sense to plug it straight in. The 1TB hard drive hooks into the Tablo box for DVR and commercial skipping capabilities. Finally, since I wanted the same experience upstairs that we have downstairs I bought a second Apple TV, but since the TV is so much smaller I opted for the slightly less expensive "HD" version instead of the "4k". When and if we upgrade the upstairs TV to 4k, I'll probably just buy another Apple TV box to go along with it. </p>
<h3>Home Network</h3>
<p>We upgraded our home cable service last year to a bundle of TV channels, home phone service, and internet. The only thing I was interested in the was the internet, but my wife enjoyed a few shows and liked having the cable, so we kept it. We needed two cable boxes, but only one of the boxes they delivered was a proper DVR, the other one would stream shows from it across the network. There was a <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/The_Mediacom_SSH_Issue/">ridiculous coax network</a> setup when Mediacom installed the cable, but I changed it so each cable box hooked up over ethernet to an Eero router to communicate over the home network, and the boxes could download the tv guide from the web. </p>
<p>The new setup has each Apple TV plugged into ethernet into an Eero router, networked to the base Eero where the Tablo box is hooked up. I've got the Tablo app downloaded on the Apple TVs which gives me a single interface for movies, tv shows, and local news, weather and sports. As a bonus, I can now watch the morning news on my iMac or MacBook in Safari by visiting my.tablotv.com. We are still in the testing things out phase, but assuming everyone's happy with the setup I'll cancel my cable and drop back down to just internet service. With the reduction in price this setup should pay for itself in about four months. </p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2020-03-16-How_Long_Will_macOS_Be_Unix?.html'>How Long Will macOS Be Unix?</a></h2>
<p><img src="/media/UNIXad.png" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>I've started to worry about the Unix core of macOS. Possibly unnecessarily, but there have been a few troubling signs over the years, the biggest of which is obviously the lack of access to a decent development environment on iOS. On iOS, web development is <em>possible</em>, but only in the barest, most basic sense of the term. As soon as you need to do anything even remotely complex, like build a Django project, run the server locally, and browse the site for testing, you are out of luck. That's fine, because it's iOS and I don't need to do development on my phone, but for years Apple has been saying that they thought iOS and specifically the iPad was the future of computing. In the past few months we've seen other signs that point towards Apple looking to simplify their products to the point where they'd no longer be usable for me. </p>
<p>Another obvious sign is that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos_release_notes/macos_catalina_10_15_release_notes">Apple has deprecated</a> what they call "scripting languages".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scripting language runtimes such as Python, Ruby, and Perl are included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software. Future versions of macOS won’t include scripting language runtimes by default, and might require you to install additional packages. If your software depends on scripting languages, it’s recommended that you bundle the runtime within the app. (49764202)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, fine, for years we've needed to download the Xcode Command Line Tools to install git and a compiler. I imagine (hope) that future versions of the download will include the scripting languages needed to bootstrap <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>.</p>
<p>What bothers me the most though is that Apple has <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/239484/does-apple-provide-a-web-site-with-content-of-man-pages-for-the-command-line-c">removed the man pages</a> from their online documentation. Even the old archived links no longer work. In fact, if you start at developer.apple.com/opensource, and follow the link at the bottom to "<a href="https://developer.apple.com/opensource/">View Unix Documentation</a>", you are brought to an extremely <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/navigation/index.html?filter=unix">out of date archive page</a> with five (5!!) links, none of which are relevant. I've been listening to Swift and Objective-C developers complain on podcasts about how the language documentation is incomplete or out of date, but that's nothing compared to what's been done to the Unix documentation. So far, the best we can get is doing a search on the open source repository… until that goes away. </p>
<p>I use a Mac because I love the simplicity and reliability of the user interface coupled with a solid Unix core, and because the indie developer community produces some of the best software in the world. The text editor I'm using now for example, BBEdit. Personally I think it's clear that the Mac's model for a software ecosystem is the best we've been able to come up with. Provide a person with the ability to craft an application themselves, and be able to make a living off of doing so by selling to a global audience. This results in high quality, sustainable software built by people who care deeply about their work and are motivated to continue developing it. Not to mention that the community built between writers, developers, artists, and hobbyists is welcoming, friendly, and inclusive. </p>
<p>One of the reasons for the Mac's success in the 2000's and 2010's is because it made such a great developer or sysadmin machine because of the Unix architecture. Being a Mac, if you never needed to know about it, you would never see it, but if you did need it, the Terminal app was always right there in the Utilities folder, pop it open and you're off to the races. Unfortunately, given recent moves by Apple, I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to stay with the mac as my primary work machine. If I literally can't get my job done, I'll be forced to go somewhere else. That really doesn't sound appealing to me.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2019-11-01-Nostalgic_Development.html'>Nostalgic Development</a></h2>
<p>Like many my age, my first introduction to writing code was creating basic web pages, mimicking what I could find by right-clicking on a site and selecting "view source". HTML was, and continues to be, simple. There are nested elements inside the top and bottom tags, and the styling sheet defines how those elements are presented. But, somewhere along the line we've collectively lost our way. </p>
<p>For example, I recently worked on a rather large Python web app. The basic concept of a web app is fine, it dynamically creates the HTML on the backend and handles the input from the page. A layer on top of the HTML, but a necessary one to develop anything dynamic. The Python environment has its own package manager, and bundling things up is fairly simple. Then the developers decided to do some <em>modernization</em> of the UI, which required significant modifications to the build pipeline. </p>
<p>Instead of a pure Python environment, we now needed Node.js. We aren't running a node server, we only need it for the build process. Not to build the actual application, mind you, just the CSS and javascript. Node famously comes with its own package manager, <code>npm</code>, and thank goodness, because our site suddenly needs 899 packages in the <code>node_modules</code> directory. Building on top of node we've got <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a> and <a href="https://webpack.js.org">webpack</a>. Webpack is a bundler used to process javascript and SASS files to compile them into javascript and CSS suitable for deployment. Why do we need <a href="https://sass-lang.com">SASS</a>? I have no idea. I also don't know why we need to compile our javascript down into bundled javascript.</p>
<p>We've taken what was simple and beautiful and piled on so much clutter and junk that it's nearly unrecognizable from the days of "view source". As in all things, I'm sure there's a lot about this situation that I don't understand. I'm sure that the developers of these projects have good intentions, and see a definite need for their work. It's just that I don't see it. I don't understand why we need these layers of abstraction. </p>
<p>I've been creating web pages for 20 years, in one form or another. I really thought that HTML 5 would be a renaissance of simple, usable web development, but for the most part, that hasn't happened. Well, at least we finally got rid of Flash.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2019-10-11-Think_About_the_Future.html'>Think About the Future</a></h2>
<p>Over the past twenty years the tech industry has greased the tracks of an express train to dystopia. As age creeps up on me and my hair continues to grey, I think back on the naive optimism of my youth with increasing nostalgia. We live in a world of constant surveillance, persistent erosions of privacy, a decline of democracy, and a rise of populist demagogues. Every new year becomes the hottest year on record, America has an obesity epidemic, and starvation is still a problem around the globe. The Amazon is on fire, opiate abuse is rampant, our kids are suffering from mental health problems, and everyone is too distracted by their phones to care. In short, we've made a mess of things. </p>
<p>Being a small part of this industry I can't help but feel some responsibility. Although I've always been a small cog in a massive machine, I've been a cog with choices, and those choices did not always turn out as hoped. The easy and human response to our situation is cynicism and scape-goating, blaming the other without accepting any of the responsibility ourselves. I find this kind of laziness unacceptable, an abdication of character and integrity. It's giving up. We can never give up.</p>
<p>Instead, I again choose optimism. Not naive optimism, but one born of experience and faith. I think most people are good, and clever, and when given the chance want to do their part. I think to share this optimism we first need a vision for the future. Not an apocalyptic future, but one where we've solved or are in the process of solving our current problems. Less Mad Max and more Star Trek. Or, somewhat more realistically, more of Microsoft's most recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-tFdreZB94">Future Vision</a> video. Technology, humanities expression of boundless problem solving ability, must be the underlying foundation for what comes next.</p>
<p>One thing we must agree on before we can move forward is that we can't go back. We can't time travel, we can't bring back "the good ol days", and we can't change our culture to recreate an imagined point in the past when things were better. The genie is out of the bottle; we have no choice but to move forward. As uncomfortable as that might make us, there really is no other choice, and anyone who tells you otherwise most likely wants something from you. Smart phones, tablets, social media, the Internet… they are all here to stay. What must change is how we use them. Technology is a tool and a mirror, how we use it shows us who we are.</p>
<p>To solve big problems we must be able to think clearly and concentrate. Luckily we've got smart people working on this problem like <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Cal Newport</a> and <a href="https://thefocuscourse.com">Shawn Blanc</a>. I submit that we need a societal shift towards a mentality that treats social media similarly to alcohol. Perfectly acceptable in moderation, can be enjoyable with friends, but improper at work or school. Or, maybe a British attitude is more appropriate, go ahead and have a pint of Twitter at lunch, then go back into your <a href="https://blog.strongproject.com/how-cal-newports-deep-work-concept-will-influence-office-design/">Eudaimonia Machine</a> at work.</p>
<p>This ability to think clearly, without distraction or interruption, must also extend into our school system. We have adopted one-to-one programs across the country that give each child a laptop, and then expect them to have the self-control to be able to use that machine to study, take tests, and do homework. Most of the machines we've given them aren't built to do that by default, they are multi-tasking environments that make it quick and easy to switch between tasks, an accident waiting to happen for an already distracted mind. Once again, we've adopted a technology without fully understanding its implications. Technology in education is a broad and deep topic that I hope to cover in more detail in the future. For now, I'll summarize my position by saying that I advocate for devices like the <a href="https://remarkable.com">re:markable e-ink tablet</a>. Not less technology, but tech better suited to the task at hand. Technology that respects our humanity, with all it’s faults and vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Once we can think clearly it will be much easier to spot partisan propaganda and "fake news". Without the talking heads on TV, podcasts, youtube and twitter drowning out intelligent conversation we can start to have meaningful debates about things that really matter. As a society, we must indemnify ourselves against phycological warfare like Brietbart and Twitter trolls. We need to be able to identify attempts to promote the false and hateful ideology that seeks to divide us and reject it. The world is awash in mammoth-sized problems, it's going to take all of us working together to solve them. We must be able to concentrate, then find common ground, and out of that a path forward.</p>
<p>And what is that path forward? What vision should we share? What do we want in the future? Clean air and water. Safe cities, thriving communities. An economy that supports small towns and big cities alike. Work that is respected regardless of if you work with your hands or your mind. Individuals with the freedom to live as they choose, and the responsibility to themselves, their family, and their community that comes with that freedom. The ability to produce and distribute enough food and fresh water that no one goes hungry or is forced to drink bad water. These problems are hard, but not impossible.</p>
<p>I can see a future where our differences are sorted out through vigorous debate. Where our technology is powered by clean, renewable energy. Where we've abandoned our dependence on the fossil fuels and plastics that are destroying our environment. Where our food, clothing, and other consumables are sustainable. This is not a utopia, I don't envision a world without crime or war, but I do envision one with much, much less hate and violence than we currently have. We can turn the tide of the mental health crisis we are currently experiencing. We can defeat the hopelessness and depression that turns people to drugs. We can build technology that prioritizes individual physical and mental health, as well as privacy, security, and autonomy.</p>
<p>We just need to decide to do it.  Let’s talk about how.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2019-09-12-The_September_2019_Apple_Event.html'>The September 2019 Apple Event</a></h2>
<p>Several more professional sites have written longer and better articles about Apple’s recent event than I can do here. A few of my favorites in no particular order are <a href="1">John Gruber’s take</a>, Ryan Christoffel and Alex Guyot  cover the <a href="2">new iPhones</a> and <a href="3">Apple Watch</a>, respectively, at MacStories, Jason Snell’s take on <a href="4">hits and misses at SixColors</a>,  it’s always worth a click to read everyone’s pal Jim Dalrymple at The Loop’s <a href="6">thoughts on the event</a>. And of course, the team at iMore has an <a href="5">entire section</a> set aside for the many articles they’ve already written about what’s new.</p>
<p>This is not a review, just my thoughts on the new products after letting the dust settle for a couple days.</p>
<h3>Apple Watch Series 5</h3>
<p>I can see myself upgrading my Series 3 for the 5. The bigger screen that debuted in the Series 4 is attractive enough, but the always on screen in the 5 really pushes it over the edge. This is the one Apple device I use every day, all day. For almost two years straight now I’ve worn my Watch nearly every day.</p>
<h3>iPad 7</h3>
<p>I have many conflicting thoughts about the modern computer for the rest of us. Setting those aside for the moment, this looks like a great update to the entry-level iPad. Larger screen and finally a proper keyboard option, but the same A10 chipset. For $330 this is the right option for someone looking for a casual computing device to take notes, watch video, send and receive emails, and surf the web.</p>
<h3>iPhone 11</h3>
<p>When compared to the XR, the iPhone 11 is an incremental update with a slightly faster CPU, slightly better battery life, a big update to the camera, and worse color options overall. I’m not a fan of the washed-out pastels, especially when compared to the vibrant and fun colors of the XR. The yellow is especially egregious.</p>
<p>That being said, it’s important to note that this is <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1151235/apple-rolls.html">how Apple rolls</a>. One small incremental update after another, and after a few the iPhone 11 is a massive update in all aspects from something like an older iPhone 6S. Color preferences are just that, <em>preferences</em>. That this year doesn’t match mine doesn’t make them bad, just not for me. What we can’t ignore is that this year Apple ships yet again another incrementally better iPhone, one that’s better in all the ways that matter from previous versions.</p>
<h3>iPhone 11 Pro Max Super Duper Cool XDR Edition</h3>
<p>Apple really can’t name anything anymore.</p>
<p>Better battery, better camera, better screen, but not better enough to justify the additional $300 the Pro costs. Not to mention that the colors for the Pro are just awful. Speaking of color, that Midnight Green looks like a sad color for a car in East Berlin before the wall fell. The gold is more of a copper, and the white is more of a cream. Space Grey remains the best option for an iPhone that lacks the color options of the 11.</p>
<p>Of all the Apple devices that are “not for me”, the Pro Max is the <em>not for me’ist</em>. I’m actually looking for ways to use my phone <em>less</em>, not more, and I’d rather have a smaller SE-sized phone than even the larger size that originated with the iPhone 6, let alone the Max.</p>
<h3>Apple Arcade</h3>
<p>$5 per month? Sold. I’m always looking for new games, and I know my kids will get a kick out of this too, especially once it’s available on the Apple TV. I’m even considering getting an Xbox One controller to turn the Apple TV into an <em>almost</em> real gaming console.</p>
<p>Also, I take back what I said previously. Apple Arcade is a great name for the service.</p>
<h3>Apple TV+</h3>
<p>$5 per month? Sold. I have high hopes for the shows they’ve advertised so far, and I think that over time the TV+ catalog will grow to a respectable size. My current plan is to drop Netflix, pick up TV+, and upgrade to the Hulu and Disney+ bundle. And maybe, someday dropping cable once more.</p>
<h3>Miscellany</h3>
<p>As discussed on the <a href="https://atp.fm/episodes/343">most recent ATP</a>, the game demos were not good. I also thought they had too many videos, and I miss Jony’s British voiceovers. I also 100% agree with Marco that the forced applause from Apple Retail employees is really starting to feel fake and cringe-worthy.
This video for the Watch was Apple at their best.</p>

<p>I realized today that it’s been ten years since I dedicated an entire post to complaining about enterprise software. In that ten years not much has changed, unfortunately. Enterprise software is still crap, and it’s still more of a hassle than it’s worth. It’s best to avoid whenever possible, so when you find yourself evaluating software or services for your company, here’s a few easy markers to identify the products you should let pass by.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enterprise software doesn’t want to tell you how much it costs. </li>
<li>Enterprise software often doesn’t even list what it does, instead it want’s to <em>partner</em> with you to provide <em>solutions</em>. </li>
<li>Enterprise software doesn’t provide you technical documentation until after you’ve paid. And even then, it’s lacking. </li>
<li>Instead of real documentation, the marketing department of enterprise software vendors will write “whitepapers”, which are entirely useless.</li>
<li>The user-facing part of enterprise software is almost always complete garbage.</li>
</ol>
<p>This last point is important because it gets to the crux of what enterprise software is: software wherein the person who pays for it is not the person who uses it. Payment for these <em>solutions</em> is handled by managers who are several steps removed from the daily process of having to put the software in place and use it as intended. What the managers need is a way to justify the exorbitant fees enterprise software vendors charge, so the vender’s sites are full of marketing jargon and various scenarios, hoping to inspire one manager to convince another manager that the price is worth it. </p>
<p>It’s not. </p>
<p>There’s almost always a better way to go about solving whatever problem an organization seeks out a vendor to solve. My personal preference is to solve it in house with open source software and custom development. That way, the money you would have spent on the garbage <em>solution</em> from an enterprise software vendor is spent investing in your own organization. Invest in yourself, solve your own problems, don’t compound your problems by buying someone else’s.</p>

<p>I bought my first Mac in 2004, a white plastic iBook G4. It was slow, the screen resolution was terrible, but wow did I love Mac OS X. After several years of loading every Linux and BSD variant I could find on the PC I bought in '99, I finally found a stable Unix-based operating system with a logical and beautiful user interface. The Mac was exactly what I wanted in a computer. I desperately wanted to use it at work, but working in a secure military environment, that wasn't going to happen.</p>
<p>After I got out of the Navy in '06 I got my first civilian job on a six-month contract in Iowa. I was issued another PC, but after poking around a bit I found an old Mac that wasn't being used, so I adopted it made it work for me. One of the lead engineers saw it once and made the off-hand comment that I should "get that piece of crap off my desk". I ignored him and carried on. My coworkers were having a LAN party one day after work, and invited me along to play some networked game. I brought my personal MacBook with me, and quickly realized that everyone else had custom built gaming PCs, and that my little laptop couldn't keep up. </p>
<p>When I found stable employment in Des Moines, I was, again, issued a PC. A Dell laptop this time. Again I found an unused Mac in a closet somewhere, a PowerMac G4, booted it up and used it as my main workstation. After a few years, and knowing my boundaries, I found it possible to work under the radar and bring my personal Mac to work, by now a MacBook Pro, and typically just dropped the Dell in a drawer. From time to time there'd be something I'd need to do with the Dell, and it'd wind up back on my desk for a bit. I remember once a coworker, who would eventually be promoted to my manager, walking by my cubicle and mocking me loudly saying "typical Mac user, Mac in front of him, PC on the side to get <em>real</em> work done." I didn't like that guy. </p>
<p>Over the years Macs have become more mainstream and I've noticed that they've become more accepted at the different places I've worked. One thing seems to not change though, whoever is in charge of taking care of employee's computers always wants Windows PCs. I imagine because they are easier to manage en masse. Even at my latest company meeting, the team was discussing some feature rollout to the PCs, and it came up that I used a Mac[^1]. I quipped that I was pretty sure that by now my using a Mac is a condition of my continued employment. (It's not.) I further quipped that they could have my Mac… when they pried it from my cold, dead hand. </p>
<p>For my entire working life outside the military, I've been the outlier who uses a Mac. By now I've been using it exclusively for so many years that I'd be completely lost in Windows. The Mac has a carefully chosen set of tools that mold perfectly to how my mind works. Things are where I expect them to be, they do what I expect them to do. As an information worker, I care deeply about the tools I use. I spend so much of my life using it, I want the experience to at least be somewhat enjoyable. I couldn't imagine working anywhere that forced me to use a PC, if they did, I'd use it to start sending out my resume immediately. </p>
<p>[^1]: My whole team uses Macs, but my team is three people, so 🤷🏻‍♂️.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2019-03-06-Setting_Up_Webster's_Dictionary.html'>Setting Up Webster's Dictionary</a></h2>
<p>Via a post I saw today from <a href="http://chrisbowler.com/journal/wrong-dictionary">Chris Bowler</a>, via a newsletter by <a href="https://www.sarahjbray.com">Sarah Bray</a>, discussing an article written by <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary">James Somers</a>, wherein he describes the writing process of <a href="http://jsomers.net/mcphee-draft-no-4.pdf">John McPhee</a>[^1], and how he uses a good dictionary to go from last draft to finished work. The emphasis here is on a <em>good</em> dictionary, namely the 1913 Webster's Unabridged. I won't attempt to describe how wonderful the dictionary is here, James did a fantastic job of that on his <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary">blog five years ago</a>. I will however say that I think his installation instructions for getting the dictionary usable on your Mac are out of date. Here's the easy way to do it.</p>
<p>First, download the compiled dictionary text. I downloaded it from a GitHub account, but who knows for how long that'll be available, so I'm hosting the download here[^2]. <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/media/Webster.s.1913.dictionary.zip">Webster.s.1913.dictionary.zip</a></p>
<p>Next, unzip the downloaded file and find the file named "Webster’s 1913.dictionary". Click on the Finder's "Go" menu and hold down the <code>⌥</code>Option key to show the hidden "Library" folder. Click on Library, and find the "Dictionaries" folder. Open it, and drag and drop the new dictionary folder into it. </p>
<p>Now when you open the macOS Dictionary app, you can go into the settings (either by pressing ⌘, or by clicking on "Dictionary" then "Preferences…" in the menu bar), scroll down a bit till you find "Webster's 1913", click the check box next to it and drag it to the top of the list. Uncheck the "New Oxford American Dictionary". Now when you click on a word in a good Mac app, then click just a <em>tad</em> bit harder[^3], you’ll get the definition from the new and improved Webster's. It'll also show up in Spotlight searches, and anywhere else the system-wide dictionary is used. </p>
<p>Now you have a far richer and more useful dictionary. A useful resource if you happen to currently be, or soon will be, a college student who needs to write often, and in volume.</p>
<p>[^1]: Good grief!
[^2]: Which, ironically, is also hosted on GitHub.
[^3]: If your Mac doesn’t have the force-press feature in the trackpad, you can hit ⌘⌃D while a word is highlighted to get the definition as well.</p>

<p>“We are all stories in the end, just make it a good one eh?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christians, shaman, poets, and authors all know one thing… what we believe shapes who we are, and the stories we tell ourselves shape those beliefs. Our lives are a self-fulfilling prophecy. We become who we believe we will become, because we take actions that are logically attuned to the story we've told ourselves about our life. Storytellers hold power, not because of wealth or authority, but because the stories they tell shape our understanding of the world around us. In turn, how we understand the world and our place in it guides our decisions and shapes our world to be more like what we believe it to be.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2019-01-16-Inessential_Thanks.html'>Inessential Thanks</a></h2>
<p>I believe this will be the last I muck about with the design of the site for the foreseeable future. After being disappointed by the available themes, and further disappointed by my own design ability, I went back to basics. And by basics I mean that I found a few sites that I like the look of and copied large chunks of HTML and CSS to build a custom Jekyll theme. </p>
<p>Readers of Brent Simmons' <a href="http://inessential.com">Inessential</a> site will probably recognize the fonts and general layout. I've added navigation at the top, minimized the layout to bare HTML5 tags, and setup some color here and there. I've also set up a bit of responsiveness for media, and syntax highlighting for code blocks. My hope is that this will be a good baseline for any future work I put into the site, but attribution must be made first. </p>
<p>I enjoy the simplicity of the design, and how clean and readable it is now. I especially like that there is no Javascript in use. Nothing but pure HTML and CSS. No tracking, no stats, nothing dynamic or fancy. It's just you, me, and the text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PS. Brent was kind enough to give his blessing to the new design, for which I'm greatly appreciative.</p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2019-01-11-Example_50031_of_Web_Developers_Overcomplicating_Projects.html'>Example 50031 of Web Developers Overcomplicating Projects</a></h2>
<p>I spent some time over the past couple nights adopting a new theme for the old digs here at jb. I found the <a href="https://github.com/nielsenramon/chalk">beautiful Chalk theme</a> by Nielsen Ramon and adopted my site to use it, including, finally, a working tags system. I'm quite happy with the tags, but I'm less happy with the bundled deployment system the theme shipped with. </p>
<p>The theme depended on NodeJS to build and deploy to GitHub for reasons that I'm sure made complete sense to the developer but I simply don't care about. The documentation says to run <code>npm run publish</code> to build and push the site, doing so runs a script that does quite a bit of mucking about with the structure of the site.  </p>
<p>```bash</p>
<h1>Checkout gh-pages branch.</h1>
<p>if [ <code>git branch | grep gh-pages</code> ]
then
  git branch -D gh-pages
fi
git checkout -b gh-pages</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>First thing we do is create a new branch and check it out. So far so good, I guess. </p>
<p>```bash</p>
<h1>Build site.</h1>
<p>yarn install --modules-folder ./_assets/yarn
bundle exec jekyll build
```</p>
<p>I'm not familier with <code>yarn</code>, but the site says that it provides "fast, reliable, and secure dependency management". Ok, fair enough, but what dependencies could my little blog possibly have? Apparently, the <code>package.json</code> file it lists what <code>yarn</code> is downloading:</p>
<p><code>javascript
  "dependencies": {
    "jquery": "^3.2.1",
    "npm": "^6.0.1",
    "retinajs": "^2.1.1",
    "svgxuse": "^1.2.4",
    "webfontloader": "^1.6.28",
    "zooming": "^2.0.0"
  }</code></p>
<p>Eh… ok. Why do I need NodeJS for this again? So, Yarn installs a bunch of Javascript and then Jekyll builds the site. Moving on… </p>
<p>```bash</p>
<h1>Delete and move files.</h1>
<p>find . -maxdepth 1 ! -name '_site' ! -name '.git' ! -name '.gitignore' -exec rm -rf {} \;
mv _site/* .
rm -R _site/</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>Now things are getting interesting. This deletes everything except the git directory, the <code>.gitignore</code> file, and the site Jekyll just built. Then it moves everything out of the <code>_site</code> directory into the root and deletes that directory as well. </p>
<p>```bash</p>
<h1>Push to gh-pages.</h1>
<p>git add -fA
git commit --allow-empty -m "$(git log -1 --pretty=%B) [ci skip]"
git push -f -q origin gh-pages</p>
<h1>Move back to previous branch.</h1>
<p>git checkout -
yarn install --modules-folder ./_assets/yarn</p>
<p><code>``
Add, commit, and push the changes to Github under the gh-pages branch, then checkout whatever you had previously and reinstall all the javascript. When I tried this my site went offline. I think this script might be out of date. GitHub requires sites that won't build in Jekyll to be in the master branch, and if you want to use a custom domain name you have to add a</code>CNAME` file with the domain name you want to use. </p>
<p>To work around this I setup a separate repository just for the source of the site and moved the built site into the master branch of the main repository. But, when I pulled everything down on my MacBook, the site wouldn't compile, with Jekyll complaining about not being able to find Jquery. It was at this point I knew that I had gone down a terrible rabbit hole.</p>
<p>Luckily, I was able to get the site built once, so I had all the "<em>compiled</em>" code to work with. All I needed to do was use those files to build my own Jekyll theme with static assets and none of this Javascript build nonesene. Apparently the original theme was trying to do something fancy with the assets by dynamically renaming them and adding assets selectively to the compiled site. I don't care about any of that. </p>
<p>Jekyll uses the liquid templating system, so it's trivial to go through the site and add tags to pull in the content you need during build time. Using the theme as shipped caused me to need three different package managers to build a static site. That's just not right. What's so wrong with HTML, CSS, and just a little bit of Javascript?</p>
<p>I don't know Nielsen, and I'm sure he had good reasons to build the theme like he did. I do think it's beautiful and I'm thankful that he released it as open source so I could use it. For me though, I don't need all those layers in my life. I just want an easy way to write and publish my site, and have it look and feel like something I care to have my name on. </p>
<p>It used to be you could learn how to build a web site by right-clicking and selecting "view source". But now, <a href="https://frankchimero.com/writing/everything-easy-is-hard-again/">everything easy is hard again</a>.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2019-01-10-Merging_the_Mac_and_the_iPad.html'>Merging the Mac and the iPad</a></h2>
<p>It seems undeniable that, <a href="http://atp.fm">given an infinite timescale</a>, Apple will eventually simplify their two most popular systems into a single platform. Merging MacOS and iOS would, theoretically anyway, provide the users with the best of both worlds, and developers would finally have a single platform to target instead of two. This concept seems to run counter to what Apple executives have said in the past about the Mac, specifically that "<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2090829/macs/apple-executives-on-the-mac-at-30-the-mac-keeps-going-forever.html">the Mac keeps going forever</a>", but the interview that statement comes from is five years old now, which… in silicon valley terms, really is forever ago.</p>
<p>Since then we've seen some interesting ideas come to market, like Microsoft's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Studio">Surface Studio</a>, a desktop computer with a 27" 4k touchscreen and stylus , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBBF4X-frOU">and an odd dial</a> that can sit either on the desk or directly on the screen. Samsung is hooking their Galaxy phones up to a keyboard, monitor, and mouse to use the phone as a desktop computer through <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/explore/dex/">the DeX dock</a>. Outside of Apple, touchscreens on mobile computers are nearly ubiquitous, from Windows 10 PCs to convertible Chromebooks. Inside of Apple though, we've seen almost no crossing of the streams… <em>almost</em>. </p>
<p>The iPad Pro is a computer unlike any other. Incredibly powerful, but hamstrung by limited software and user interaction capabilities. Geek Bench <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/ios-benchmarks">scores are impressive</a>, but you can't hook up a thumb drive. It looks like a good device for free-form drawing and artistic work, but outside of basic static sties you can't use it for web development. More than anything, iOS's reimagining of an operating system for the modern, mobile world eschews decades of proven user experience work that's gone into the MacOS user interface. MacOS is consistent, discoverable, and reliable. A good Mac app behaves similarly to the other apps that run on the Mac. Copy &amp; paste, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/12/ios_still_hasnt_gotten_undo_right">undo &amp; redo</a>, and <a href="https://mattgemmell.com/mac-keyboard-shortcuts/">standard keyboard shortcuts</a> function the same across well-designed 3rd party apps and Apple's own bundled apps. At least they did, until Mojave.</p>
<p>Mojave introduced four new bundled applications to the Mac. Home, News, Stocks, &amp; Voice Memos were ported directly over from iOS using an as-yet-unnamed unified development framework popularly referred to as <a href="https://www.imore.com/marzipan">Marzipan</a>. Apparently the framework is only half-baked, because the apps themselves do not at all act like they belong on the platform. Keyboard shortcuts are missing, UI elements are entirely out of place, it's a mess. On a recent episode of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2018/12/24/ep-238">The Talk Show</a>, Jason Snell and John Gruber discuss the future of these apps, and Snell suggests that what makes a "Mac app" might be changing to meld around what these new iOS apps on the Mac become once the framework is more stable. Niether Jason nor John are slouches when it comes to discussing the Mac, but in this particular case I think Jason is wrong. </p>
<p>What makes a good Mac app is not an indiscernable feel or look to the application. A good Mac app behaves the way that the Mac has taught people to expect applications to behave since 1984. That's how an application looks and feels like it belongs on the Mac, when things are where they are expected to be, and the application responds as expected when the user interacts with it. If Apple wants to bring iOS apps to the Mac, I certainly hope they have more in store <a href="http://benjaminmayo.co.uk/marzipan">than this</a>. These iOS apps are going to have to learn to behave how the users of the platform expect them to behave, not the other way around.</p>
<p>In many ways, I think Apple found themselves at this crossroads almost on accident. In fact, I think the "macification" of the iPad is to its detriment. iOS was never meant to be used the way the iPad Pro is advertised. Features like multitasking and windowing seem like they were wedged into the OS when Apple found themselves with a less popular platform than they'd hoped. Apple thought that the iPad was the future of computing… <a href="https://marco.org/2017/01/31/the-wrong-future">what if they're wrong</a>?</p>
<p>Apple stubbornly wants the iPad to be the future of computing, so they've been focusing on making it more capable for <em>power users</em>, adding more and more hardware power and confusing the pure simplicity of iOS with undiscoverable features and unfulfilled promises. What if, in the next couple years, Apple decides to right the ship and build a truly <em>good</em> MacBook/iOS hybrid? </p>
<p>What about <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/306">an ARM mac</a> with a detachable touchscreen? Or one that folds over on itself? What if Apple learned all the best lessons from Microsoft's experiments with their Surface lineup and <em>did it right</em> with the Mac? What about an iMac you can draw on? I'd love to be able to create my OmniGraffle drawings on my Mac with a huge canvas and an Apple Pencil. I'd love to be able to use touch on my Mac to interact with the UI when appropriate, and use the trackpad and keyboard when not. Let the Mac grow the way the users actually want it to grow and let the iPad go back to being <em>just</em> the best tablet on the market. Apple could simplify iOS again, and concentrate on making the Mac the best tool for <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/A_New_macOS/">getting things done</a>.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2019-01-07-a_dream_jekyll_app.html'>A Dream Jekyll App</a></h2>
<p>I've never been 100% happy with this site. On the one hand, Jekyll lets me have full control of my content, and I never have to worry about losing any of it or having anything locked inside a database on a server somewhere. On the other hand, things like adding media is more complicated than I'd like. I've written scripts to help, of course, but I'd really rather have the best of both worlds. </p>
<p>I've considered creating an application to manage this for me. Like <a href="https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> for Jekyll and GitHub Pages. A text editor with a git client and an understanding of Jekyll site structure. It could even let the user sign up for GitHub and setup the repository. I thought I might setup my old Paragraphs app to do this for me… I could tear out the site rendering code and replace it with a wrapper around a libgit2. But, the text editor in Paragraphs needs a lot of work, and there would be multiple parts of the app that would need considerable rework to get it to an even <em>barely functional</em> state. The other option would be to create a new app from scratch, but at this point if you aren't creating an iOS app in Swift when starting anew what are you even doing with your life? Problem is I don't know either Swift or iOS development. My skills in this area are basically outdated. </p>
<p>A search for "Jekyll" in the Mac App Store finds one result, for a "markup viewer" app with dubious usefulness. A quick Duck search finds a couple people with the same idea, one that setup a web GUI, which is not at all what I'm talking about, and one that started something five years ago and never finished it. From what I can tell, the app that I want doesn't exist. Too bad <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a> and <a href="https://ia.net/writer">IA Writer</a> added support for Medium into their apps instead of GitHub pages. </p>
<p>So should I build this app or not? It's basically a text editor that you can drop media on, hit publish, and have it push the site to GitHub. The same thing I have now, but automated, simple, and beautiful. Is there a market for this style of app? Would GitHub allow it? Could I learn the skills required to create it in a reasonable time? iOS development is supposed to be easier than macOS… but I'm not sure that applies when you're carrying so much baggage around from the old style of development. </p>
<p>In the end, I'm not sure it'd be worth the effort for me. I've already got a beautiful text editor, and my scripts and workflows make it simple for me to create and publish new posts. I think I've talked myself out of building this app myself, but darned if I wouldn't love for someone else to build it.</p>

<p>The recent hubbub about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/apples_terrible_no_good_very_bad_earnings_warning">Apple's earnings guidance</a> has "analysts" and pundits talking a lot about China and the global economic situation. I'm sure there's something to all that, but my take is simpler… the new iPhones are priced too high.</p>
<p>I'm not ready to spend a thousand bucks on a new phone, even though the X-series looks very nice. I've talked to several other people who feel the same way I do, one just this morning, even though we are both still running the 6S. Personally, at this price, I'll keep running my phone till it doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, if Apple came out with a real successor to the iPhone SE, maybe an X-series SE at a similar price point as the previous SE, I'd be very interested in that. But, we'll see how the next year or so plays out. </p>

<p>CPG Gray and Myke Hurley have been talking about assigning a <em>theme</em> to a year on their <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex">Cortex podcast</a>, in lieu of new year's resolutions. I quite like this idea, and I've decided to adopt it. I've decided that my personal theme for 2019 is <strong>finishing</strong>. </p>
<p>Over the years I've started, made significant progress, and then dropped several projects once they got to a state I considered "good enough". I care about the projects too much to drop them completely, but I've lacked the motivation to drive them the final mile to completion. </p>
<p>I've waffled a bit on adopting this theme because there is something to be said for leaving things behind that don't work, but after considering it for a while it actually fits perfectly. It's time to make a decision. This year, I'll either finish the project, or leave it behind forever. </p>
<p>So, what kind of projects? </p>
<ul>
<li>This site</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ibuys">My old Mac apps</a></li>
<li>The NaNoWriMo Manuscript</li>
<li>Basement living spaces (trim, new carpet, etc…)</li>
<li>Landscaping</li>
<li>Running a marathon</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of this falls under the heading of "one of these days…"; adopting <em>finishing</em> as my theme of the year is mentally preparing myself for the fact that the day has come. Posting here is just further motivation not to publicly embarrass myself by not following through. This time next year, we'll see how much I was actually able to get done, and what got left behind.</p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2018-12-17-Software_Subsciptions_and_Native_Apps.html'>Software Subscriptions and Bundled Apps</a></h2>
<p>The Omni Group's recent announcement that they'd have a subscription option for OmniFocus has me thinking about how I'm going to be handling third-party software in the future. I'm not angry at them, they are still (for now) offering OmniFocus for purchase, but I wonder how much longer they'll want to keep with the old-style model of licensing when and if subscriptions turn out to be far more lucrative. </p>
<p>On the one hand, software developers need a sustainable business model, and if the market of available Mac users to sell to is not getting any bigger, they need to figure out how to keep getting money out of the people they've already sold to. It's a simple enough equation. On the other hand though, we could wind up with a lot of subscriptions. Off the top of my head I've already got:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cable TV</li>
<li>Netflix</li>
<li>Hulu</li>
<li>Amazon Prime</li>
<li>My local paper (Yep, I still read the paper)</li>
<li>Apple Music</li>
<li>2 TB of iCloud Drive</li>
<li>SiriusXM</li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest, the list is a bit ridiculous, but different people in my household enjoy different things, and so here we are. Hopefully several of these will be cancelled in the next year or two.</p>
<p>I've tended to avoid most software subscriptions. When TextExpander switched to a subscription I exported all my snippets and bought Keyboard Maestro. Over the past year I've cancelled Bear and Ulysses, opting instead for Apple's Notes app for the former, and nothing yet for the latter. When I start working on my novel again, it's likely that I'll switch to Scrivner, unless they too go to subscriptions, at which point I'll probably toss a coin between the two. </p>
<p>Bear was already in a bit of a precarious position because the bundled Notes app Apple makes has gotten so good in the past few years. OmniFocus is in a similar position with Reminders. While Reminders and OmniFocus are two very different apps, at the core they both do the same thing, give me lists of tasks to do. OmniFocus is obviously far more powerful, and better at giving me the right thing to work on at the right time, but I could get by with Reminders. Come to think of it, I could get by with pen and paper… I did so for years before I converted to OmniFocus. </p>
<p>Being "Sherlocked" has never been a good thing for developers. They are always in a better position when their application offers something that Apple is unlikely to copy or absorb into their operating system. MindNode for example, Day One and OmniGraffle come to mind as well. If developers are going to be asking consumers for more money, the value of the software they deliver must be significantly higher than what is available for free out of the box with macOS. </p>
<p>I truly want to see the Apple developer community thrive, but I'm not sure how far I'm willing to go with them on this journey to everything being a subscription.</p>

<p>Sometimes even I get caught up in waves of pessimism, and the recent onslaught of negativity against smart phones, social media, and technology in general has been no exception. It was while I was mulling over the affect of technology on our society that I watched the most recent Apple event where they released an updated MacBook Air, Mac Mini, and a new line of iPad Pros. The Air and the Mini look great, although it’s too bad that they are more expensive than previous models. What really caught my attention though were the iPads.</p>
<p>I’m drawn to the iPad in a way that’s difficult to explain. It’s an embodiment of an optimistic view of the future of technology and society, where our computing devices silently and invisibly do their jobs in the background of our lives. Apple likes to use the term “magical” in their marketing copy, and while I don’t like the term used in the way they do, I think it does somewhat apply to the iPad[^1]. A pane of glass the size of a sheet of paper that becomes whatever the app on it is. The rest of the device disappears behind the application, so that what you are holding is an email, a web browser, a game, a calendar… whatever you need it to be. Your gateway to knowledge, work, and entertainment looks <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdCCB0NXEAAYG7r.jpg">less like this</a>, and <a href="https://cdn.cultofmac.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/stevejobsipad-e1349433508120.jpg">more like this</a>.</p>
<p>The iPad is a device designed to fit into a natural way of living. What can be more fitting than sitting down with something you can hold in your hand and examining it? Or walking around with it and taking notes of the things you see? In many ways the Apple Watch is the best current example of invisible technology. It sits on my wrist and silently enhances my day, encouraging me to be more healthy, active, and to take time to be still and breath once in a while. I’ll have more to say about the watch at a later date, probably a one-year review. So far, I’ve worn it every day since I got it for Christmas last year. </p>
<p>Of course, humans being the ridiculous creatures that we are, we always find ways to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_overuse">screw things up</a>. What good thing has humanity not decided to take too much of? I like the iPad, and the iPhone too, but what I don’t like are the applications that have been designed to prey on innate weaknesses in the human psyche. Like rats in a maze, we get hits of dopamine in our brains when we see someone “liked” something we’ve shared. Sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat have been intentionally designed specifically to target those areas of the brain that are susceptible to addiction. This is bad, but it’s not the iPad or iPhone’s fault. </p>
<p>These devices are <em>tools</em>. Amazing, incredible, mind-boggling tools, but still tools. What’s important to remember is that the iPad becomes whatever app you are running at the time. So if you run Snapchat, that’s what the device <em>is</em>. On the other hand, if you run OmniFocus, the iPad becomes something else entirely. The problem is not in the technology; it is, of course, <em>in us</em>. Luckily, I think that’s the conclusion the rest of the world will come to eventually as well. Technology advances so much faster than social norms can keep up with, it takes us a while to realize what we are doing to ourselves. Like smoking, it’s my opinion that social media without limits, as we know it now, will be regulated to the fringes within a generation.</p>
<p>Finally, now that I’ve talked myself out of running away to the woods and living in a cave for the rest of my life, what about that new iPad Pro? </p>
<p><a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/the-new-129-and-11-inch-ipad-pros-the-macstories-overview/">MacStories</a> and <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/10/brooklyn-event-impressions-the-ipad-pro-is-a-computer/">Six Colors</a> have good initial write-ups, but what caught my eye the most was the switch from a lightning port to USB-C. My ears pricked up when Apple highlighted during the keynote that you could use this port to hook straight up to an external monitor, which is one of the <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/Using_a_Mac/">items on my list</a> of what the iPad needs to be a working machine for <em>most</em> people. The external monitor support looks pretty limited however, leaving it up to the application for how they wish to deal with it. Par for the course so far, it seems the hardware for the iPad is miles ahead of the software. </p>
<p>But does it really matter in my concept of future work and how I’d <em>like</em> to work? I’m not sure it does anymore. If my dream of future technology is to be able to pick up my workspace and walk anywhere and be able to sit down and get right to work, perhaps the iPad is closer now than it ever has been in the past. I still need to be able to type, but I also need to read and take notes, participate in meetings, make network diagrams, and interact with the various web-based consoles I depend on for my work. Of course, I could do all that with a MacBook now, but a MacBook brings with it macOS and a long history of computing ideas that iOS eschews. Perhaps my list is not as important as I thought. Maybe the 2018 iPad Pro is the device I’ve been waiting for to make the technology necessary in my life disappear. I’m intrigued once again. </p>
<p>[^1]: I still extremely dislike the name “iPad”. “Slate” or “Canvas” would have been so much better. It’s too bad Apple married themselves to the “iSomething” moniker.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2018-10-25-The_Typewriter_Project.html'>The Typewriter Project</a></h2>
<p><img alt="the desk" src="/media/type_desk.jpg" /></p>
<p>A phrase I've found myself repeating to friends and family from time to time recently is that "some things used to be better". As a technologist, and an optimist, I'm normally very positive about the future, but lately I’ve come to think about the place some modern technology has in our lives as increasingly negative. I’m rethinking, yet again, our relationship with the many devices we’ve invited into our lives. </p>
<p>While I was pondering this topic and waiting for the mechanic to finish with my car I wandered into a second-hand store and found this beauty of a machine on sale for $5. Of course I brought it home. The typewriter is a Montgomery Ward Signature 440T, made in Nagoya, Japan in 1968[^1]. It appears to be in perfect working order, although it’s extremely dirty inside. My intention is to restore it as best I can, which for the moment I believe means taking it apart and cleaning it, then putting it back together. I’ll put a new ribbon on it, and from there I think it’ll be ready to type. </p>
<p><img alt="the desk" src="/media/typewriter.jpg" /></p>
<p>Perhaps I’ll send out a letter or two with it. Maybe address envelops. I don’t know that it’s really got a lot of practical use other than looking cool on my desk, but it’s a project, a hobby, and things done for fun don’t need to be practical. </p>
<p>The machine is entirely mechanical. No electricity, and it’s lasted fifty years so far. I imagine it could last another fifty if I take care of it. I don’t think I can say the same about my iPhone or the iMac I’m writing this on. Eventually the components in both devices will wear out. The battery will fail to take a charge, the screen will start to fade, the drives will start to give errors. Things break over time, and in our disposable culture the answer is to throw it away and buy another one. Meanwhile, the typewriter I bought for five bucks has lasted for fifty years.</p>
<p>It’s a single-purpose machine. Created back before attention was a sparse commodity. Before the Internet, before smartphones, before twitter or facebook. All gears and pulleys, levers and hammers. You have to think hard about what you are writing, and not make any mistakes while typing. If you do you have to pull the entire page out and start over again. </p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about what we’ve lost, and what we’ve gained over the years. It’s true that the Internet enables new business models, my own included, but are we really better off now? I’m not sure we can objectively say that the Internet has made the world a better place. Have smartphones made us happier? Research says we are now more alone and isolated than ever, with increasing rates of depression and negativity. Politically we are at each others throats, failing to see the world as it is and instead seeing it through the lens of partisanship. 24-hour news creates catastrophes where there were none, everything is an emergency. </p>
<p>In the middle of all this, we are struggling to find peace, happiness, acceptance, and love. The Amish reject any technology that they feel would pull them apart instead of bringing them closer together. I think they are on to something there. Of course, I have no intention of converting, but it does leave me wondering “where do we go from here?”</p>
<p>I’ve said for a while that I thought the best technology was nearly invisible, silently enhancing our lives in the background while we go about our day. Unfortunately, today’s technology has been developed to provide what people <em>want</em>, but too often ignores what they <em>need</em>. I wonder if what we need most is a cultural shift to view the negative aspects of technology as being as harmful to us as cigarettes and alcohol. Sure, the smoker loves to smoke, but it’s killing him. Looks like all of us love social media too, but it’s breaking us from the inside. There’s something about the psychology of being online that changes our behavior in ways that are completely aberrant. </p>
<p>The affects of computers and the internet on our society are compounding. My wife is a teacher, and the school started giving the kids computers years ago. Now she’s thinking about going back to books and paper just so she can get the kids to pay attention to the class and not be distracted by what the computer provides. What will happen to these kids in the next ten to fifteen years? Will they be able to concentrate on hard problems at all? </p>
<p>For thousands of years people lived pretty much the same from one generation to the next. Technology has always advanced, but never so fast as it has in the past one-hundred years. So much has changed at such an unprecedented pace. Our psyches and our bodies are not prepared for what the technology has given us. </p>
<p>It’s possible that I’m getting to a certain age where people tend to reminisce about how things were when they were young, but I don’t feel like I’m quite that old yet. It’s just a different world now. Is it the world we want it to be? I wonder. I look at my typewriter project and wonder. </p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2018-09-06-Less,_But_Better.html'>Less, But Better</a></h2>
<p>I'm becoming increasingly interested in an emerging line of Eink devices that intentionally do less than other devices in the same category. Of course, the oldest and most widely known device is the Amazon Kindle, which my wife still claims as the best gift I ever gave her. </p>
<p><img src="/media/kindle.jpg" /></p>
<p>It's thin, and about the width and height of a paperback book, but light enough to throw in her purse. The battery lasts for weeks and she devours books on it. It is a single-purpose device that excels at that purpose, even though there are other tablets that can do more, and are similar in size and price. They do more, but they don't do the one thing she wants to do with the device quite as well. </p>
<p>The next logical step up from the kindle is <a href="https://remarkable.com">reMarkable</a>, "the paper tablet". An Eink tablet dedicated to being an electronic notebook, and <em>only</em> an electronic notebook. The reMarkable comes with a special purpose stylus that lets you write and draw on the tablet, including marking up PDFs. There are no "apps" for the tablet, no internet access, just the tablet, the stylus, and your thoughts. If the price point for the tablet were not so high, I'd consider getting one myself, but at $600 it's still a bit steep for me. But… <em>maybe</em>. </p>
<p>If I were to decide on getting a reMarkable, I'd most likely also back the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/light-phone-2#/">Light Phone II</a>. </p>
<p><img src="/media/lightphone.png" /></p>
<p>This is a phone that intentionally only does a small handful of tasks. Phone calls, texts, a contacts list, and an alarm clock. The original Light Phone was meant to be paired with your smartphone, this one is intended to stand alone. It's been a few years since I went without an iPhone, and I honestly have mixed feelings about the possibility of going back. But the Light Phone doesn't <em>feel</em> like going backwards, it feels like the next step forward. </p>
<p>Moving forward, like this <a href="https://www.android.com/object/vote/magic-calendar/">calendar concept</a> from <a href="http://www.koshotsuboi.com/index.html">Kosho Tsuboi Design</a>. </p>
<p><img src="/media/magic-calendar.jpg" /></p>
<p>A beautifully conceptualized calendar intended to hang on the wall of your home. Unfortunately, we can't go out and buy this calendar just yet. I believe we are still waiting on the technology to advance sufficiently for it to be a reasonable purchase. But, the concept behind it is in a similar vein to the previous three items. A dedicated device that does one thing, does it <em>very</em> well, is low power, low maintenance, and just blends into the background of your life. It becomes the invisible computing goal I've been pursuing for the past fifteen years. </p>
<p>For the longest time I thought Apple was going to be the one to deliver on invisible computing, and I still think they've got a foot in the door. However, I can't help but think how much better an Apple Watch might be if it had an Eink display and was dedicated solely to fitness tracking and telling me the time. What would a MacBook with an Eink display and an arm processor look like? A dedicated writing machine with a battery that lasted for weeks? If nothing else it's an interesting thought experiment.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams">Dieter Rams</a> applied the phrase "less but better" to his approach to design, I apply it to what I want out of life. Less busyness, less junk, less drama, better relationships, better activities, better adventures. In the same way that I want to own less things, but better things, I want the devices I own to do less, but to do it better than their multifunction counterparts. Most of all, I want the devices we own to respect the humanity in our lives, not exploit our psychology for corporate greed. There's truth in what these projects are doing, but will it be enough to be successful?   </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2018-08-29-Taking_Notes.html'>Taking Notes</a></h2>
<p>I loved Yojimbo for many years. I still think it’s the most “Mac-like” app for taking notes and storing data. The best thing about it was that when capturing data with the hotkey, it would look at your clipboard before presenting you with a UI, and customize the UI for the data. It was fast, fit in perfectly with the Mac, and was rock-solid reliable.</p>
<p>But, time passed, things changed, the iPhone changed computing forever, and Yojimbo just didn’t keep up. it didn’t adopt a widescreen view, it didn’t offer iCloud sync, it didn’t have an iPhone app, it didn’t adopt the new UI widgets for the toolbar, it didn’t adopt Markdown, etc…. It still works, but it feels old and stagnate.</p>
<p>I’ve talked to the devs a few times, and they always give the same feedback. No future plans for an iPhone app. No plans to change anything, just to keep it running as is. So, I too started looking elsewhere.</p>
<p><em>DEVONthink</em></p>
<p>Great app, really, but holy cow is it deep and complicated. It can do so much, whenever I spend a significant amount of time using it I start to feel overwhelmed and start questioning how much I really need a single app to do everything when there are individual apps that do things better. Like the text editor, and the PDF markup. Hazel can automatically file things for you, although not based on AI, but it does a good job.</p>
<p>The ability to capture text and web archives is good. And if you really need deep textual analysis of your data, this is the way to go. If not, there are other alternatives.</p>
<p><em>Evernote</em></p>
<p>Did you know Evernote use to be an app that was just one long page? That might have been an early beta or something, I don’t know. Anyway, again, for capturing text and web content, it does a great job, but it’s not really Mac-like, and it’s still a bit of a roach motel for data. Also, I’ve run into weird limits on things when I really start digging in. For me, I’d rather my data stayed on my Mac in a format that I can move around. Except…</p>
<p><em>Bear</em></p>
<p>My current favorite for managing text, some images, and some captured web content. It doesn’t save web archives, but the Safari plugin will grab the text of the page you are looking at and try to extract the text to Markdown. It does a fair job. Great for storing bits of code and random pieces of information that I know I’ll need later.</p>
<p><em>Apple Notes</em></p>
<p>Rich text formatting leaves something to be desired, but syncing is solid and Notes does a good job of being a reliable place to put data. If Apple merged the best of Notes and Bear we’d have a winner. That stupid textured background always annoys me though.</p>
<p><em>Eagle Filer</em></p>
<p>A lot like Yojimbo, but it gets updated far more often and keeps data in an open format. Unfortunately it also suffers from the same drawbacks in sync and iOS companion apps. And it also looks dated to my eyes :man_shrugging:t2:.</p>
<p><em>Everything Else</em></p>
<p>Let’s not forget crowd favorite Simplenote + NVAlt, which I suppose is still a thing but I’m not sure Brett is ever going to release that updated NVAlt replacement. Then there’s Microsoft’s OneNote, which Circus Ponies blames for killing their Notebook app. If you’re into Microsoft, I guess that’s another way to go. There’s Keep It Together, which I think was renamed just “Together”, and I think abandoned. There’s StickyBrain, which became SOHO Notes, which is now Notelife… I guess? Oh, and let’s not forget the new hotness of Agenda, which combines Notes and a Calendar.</p>
<p><em>The Finder</em></p>
<p>Overwhelmed? Me too. That’s why I just went back to the Finder. I feel your pain, I really do. I’ve tried every application, method, and system out there to manage my data, and I still don’t have a perfect system. If Yojimbo was modernized and an iPhone app created, I think I’d have it, but as it is, Bare Bones just doesn’t have the motivation to work on it.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2018-08-28-Simple_File_Encryption_for_macOS.html'>Simple File Encryption for macOS</a></h2>
<p>For years now I’ve wanted a simple way to encrypt or decrypt a file in macOS, so this morning I built it. This takes five to ten minutes to setup, and provides the encryption service as a right-click menu item and a pair of folders with folder actions enabled. Here’s what I did. </p>
<p>First, I installed the command line utility <code>ccrypt</code> with Homebrew: <code>brew install ccrypt</code>.</p>
<p>Next, I added a hidden config file containing my secret key in <code>~/.ccrypt</code> and saved the key to 1Password. </p>
<p>Then, I created two new services in Automator with a single action of “Run Shell Script. The services accept files or folders in Finder, and have the “Pass input: “ setting of the Run Shell Script action set to “as arguments”.  The  Encrypt File service looks like this:</p>
<p>```bash
EXTEN="cpt"</p>
<p>for FILENAME in "$@"
do
    if test "${FILENAME#*$EXTEN}" != "$FILENAME"
    then
        echo "Already encrypted."
    else
        /usr/local/bin/ccencrypt -k ~/.ccrypt $FILENAME
    fi</p>
<p>done</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>And the Decrypt File service is only slightly different: </p>
<p>```bash
EXTEN="cpt"</p>
<p>for FILENAME in "$@"
do
    if test "${FILENAME#*$EXTEN}" != "$FILENAME"
    then
        /usr/local/bin/ccdecrypt -k ~/.ccrypt $FILENAME
    else
        echo "Already decrypted."
    fi</p>
<p>done</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>The first line in the script sets the EXTEN variable to “cpt”, which is what the <code>ccrypt</code> executable adds as a file extension when it encrypts a file. Next I setup a for loop to cycle through all of the selected files, and then do a test to see if the file being looked at already has the “cpt” extension or not. This is especially important when setting up a folder action, because when the file is encrypted it will drop in as a new file in the folder, which will then attempt to encrypt it again unless this check is preset. </p>
<p>After saving these two Automator services you should be able to right click on any file in the Finder and encrypt it, and then the same again to decrypt. I’ve also added the two scripts as folder actions to two folders name “Encrypted” and “Decrypted”, so if I’d rather move and encrypt the files, I can just drag and drop them on the folders. </p>
<p>All in all, this gives me a little more peace of mind about saving files in iCloud and syncing them between my two Macs. They won’t be available in iOS, but for the types of files I need on both machines, that’s not a problem.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2018-08-16-Day_One,_Ulysses,_and_Bear.html'>Day One, Ulysses, and Bear</a></h2>
<p>I’ve been using, and subscribing to, <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a>, <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com">Bear</a>, and <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> for a while now. It seems a bit silly, especially since they all do basically the same thing. On the surface they are all writing apps, but once I start to think a little deeper about them I can see where the differences lay. </p>
<p><em>Ulysses</em></p>
<p>Ulysses is for <em>writing</em>, the act of thinking through ideas and putting them on a page. That’s what it’s designed for, and that’s what it’s best at. That’s why the first draft of my book is in here. In long-form writing and exporting text into multiple formats, Ulysses excels. Even the little features, like <a href="https://ulysses.app/tutorials/goals/">daily writing goals</a>, are geared towards helping you be the best writer you can be. </p>
<p><em>Bear</em></p>
<p>Bear <em>can</em> do most of the things that Ulysses can do, but less elegantly. Bear can store long-form text, but that’s not what it’s designed for, it’s designed to be the notebook you keep in your back pocket. It’s a <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/#features">note-taking app</a>. A storage space for bits of code, a <a href="http://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing/">Zettelkasten</a> for keeping bits of information that I might need some day. There’s quite a bit of overlap between Ulysses and Bear, but the features slightly lean one way or the other, for taking notes in Bear, and writing projects in Ulysses. </p>
<p><em>Day One</em></p>
<p>This is my journal. Day One is <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/category/uses/">a diary app</a>, a place to record and reflect on where you’ve been and what you’ve done throughout the day. It’s my running journal, a record of films I’ve watched and what I thought of them. It’s my ongoing record of my life… travels and all. It’s also, recently, where I’ve started storing my daily work journal. </p>
<p><em>What I’d Lose</em></p>
<p>I suppose the reason I’m using Ulysses less is because I’m not doing quite as much long-form writing. If I got back to blogging regularly, and if I made an effort to work on my book, I’d have more time spent in this app. But, it seems like I need Bear far more often for my day job, and even this text I’m writing now is going to end up in Day One, or maybe on my blog.</p>
<p>If I moved my journaling into this app, I’d lose the end-to-end encryption and location recording that Day One does. Day One makes a note of the weather, the date and time, and address where you recorded the entry. I’d lose all that in moving to Ulysses. </p>
<p>If I moved my note-taking into Ulysses, I feel like I might lose some of the mental separation between my writing and my notes. I’d also lose Bear’s code blocks and syntax highlighting, which I use all the time. I’ve got a lot of little code snippets and command line scripts saved in Bear, and Ulysses just doesn’t capture code blocks the same way. </p>
<p>So, in the end, I’m sticking with the three writing apps. Their role is well-defined, they fit in my workflow, and they’ve earned my trust. I suppose that’s all I can ask for.  </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2018-08-07-It’s_Not_About_the_Apps.html'>It’s Not About the Apps</a></h2>
<p>David and Katie are great, they really are. I’ve enjoyed MPU, like most of you have, for years. I’ve bought the books, the scanners, implemented the workflows, heck, my paperless workflow is <em>still</em> a derivative of David’s book. Most of all though, I’ve bought the apps. Lots of apps, and there’s a couple things to say about that. </p>
<p>For one, I like being part of the Mac community, always have, and I like supporting independent developers. Secondly, many times indie devs have more incentive to make their apps the best they can possibly be, and I’ve often found that the smaller, and older, the team, the higher quality the app. For example, BBEdit, MarsEdit, Keyboard Maestro, Acorn, etc...</p>
<p>However, there’s another aspect to this discussion. You don’t buy your way into becoming a power user. You become a power user by understanding your Mac and knowing when and where buying an app makes sense in your personal workflow. I’d argue that if you’re not writing code, BBEdit is probably not for you. If you don’t already know that having a text expansion tool will save you hours of work every year, than it probably doesn’t fit into your workflow and doesn’t make sense to buy it. </p>
<p>Having a ton of system modification apps running doesn’t make you a power user, but knowing which ones to run and why does. There are things macOS doesn’t do that you might find useful in a third party app, but understanding the what, why, and how is the key. </p>
<p>And finally, and most importantly, have fun! In the end that’s what this is all about. Get your work done, do it efficiently, and have a good time doing it.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2018-03-26-a-fresh-coat-of-paint.html'>A Fresh Coat of Paint</a></h2>
<p>I spent some time remodeling the old digs here, adding a fresh coat of paint in the form of a new theme, new hosting, and a shiny new SSL lock. </p>
<p>The new paint comes in the form of the <a href="https://github.com/broccolini/swiss">Swiss Jekyll Theme</a>, which I just thought looked like fun while keeping the site readable. The only configuration I did was to switch the theme color to orange, just to brighten things up a bit. And I like orange. I decided a while back that designing my own theme comes at the price of me not writing as much, because I tend to spend too much time tweaking the theme. Now, I search around and browse through twenty or thirty themes till I find a few that I like, then I download each of them and drop my content in them, run the site locally and see how my posts look. Most of the time I just go with my gut… do I feel happy when I look at the site? If not, I move on. For now, I’m happy with how this looks. </p>
<p>I was inspired by Jack Baty’s post on <a href="https://www.baty.net/2018/moving-to-amazon-s3/">moving to Amazon</a> to migrate my own blog over to S3 and CloudFront. I love that the SSL comes along for the ride. Although I don’t need it for anything here, at least Chrome users won’t be subject to a warning when visiting my site. I remember advocating for doing this back in 2002 in a paper I wrote for college, encrypt everything. </p>
<p>Apart from that, the site is still my outlet for talking about technology, design, and culture. It’s a place for me to own my words, and hopefully say something useful. Maybe, someday years from now, my kids or my grandkids will find this and have some idea of who I was, and what I stood for. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2018-03-07-The_Mediacom_SSH_Issue.html'>The Mediacom SSH Issue</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes it’s a miracle the Internet works at all. For the past week or so I’ve been unable to clone, pull from, or push to private Git repositories from either Bitbucket or Github using the normal <code>git clone git@bitbucket.org:whatever/whatevs.git</code> syntax. The problem had the symptoms of a blocked port or a bad network route; I’d issue the command in Terminal and wait, and wait, and wait, and the command would eventually timeout. After a quick look at the Github documentation I tried <code>ssh -T git@github.com</code> which also timed out and confirmed my suspicions. The ssh protocol was not getting through, but VPN and normal web traffic was. </p>
<p>My first thought was that the issue was probably related to my new Mediacom modem. For my wife’s sake, we recently went back to cable, and when the installer came out to the house he replaced my modem with a newer, fancier one. I don’t think I needed the upgrade, although my speed has been bumped up a bit since the new one was put in, so whatever. Along with the new modem the installer was insisting on setting up “home networking”, which is Mediacom’s way of charging you to use their crappy wireless built into the modem. I explained to the installer that not only do I not need his assistance setting up my network, but that I also have invested in a very nice <a href="https://eero.com">Eero mesh networking</a> setup that was far better than anything Mediacom could give me. </p>
<p>This resulted in a few phone calls between the installer and his supervisor. The installer informed me that he couldn’t turn off home networking or I’d be charged an additional $40 per month. That seemed ridiculous to me, but again, whatever, I asked the installer to just make sure my wireless worked the way it did before he came out. He obliged, my speed was good, and he finished setting up cable and left. </p>
<p>It wasn’t for a day or two that I noticed the ssh problem. It was easy enough to verify that the issue was isolated to my home network using the Instant Hotspot ability of my iPhone. I verified that ssh to my repositories still worked over cellular, and decided to get in touch with Mediacom. But, knowing what I know of them, I figured I’d better cover all my bases and also get in touch with Eero. </p>
<p>I thought I might need to talk to them because I have “Advanced Security” turned on in Eero Plus. This, among other things, checks outbound traffic for known malicious destinations and blocks it. I wondered if it might mistakenly be blocking my SSH traffic, but after contacting Eero support on Twitter they verified that was not the case. They did however point to what proved to be the problem. Eero advised me to contact Mediacom and make sure that the modem was in bridge mode and that we were not in a double-NAT setup. After checking my Eero’s networking settings I saw that it had a private IP address and knew that had to be the case. </p>
<p>Then I waited a week to get in touch with Mediacom because I figured explaining all this to tech support would be a nightmare. </p>
<p>Turns out, it wasn’t so bad. The first person I talked to had no idea what was going on and sent me over to “Tier 2”. Tier 2 helpfully explained that they do not offer ssh service, which I was fine with because I didn’t want to ssh to Mediacom. Then my call was disconnected while I was on hold, so I called back. The third person I talked to understood exactly what I needed. He was able to turn off the wireless networking on my modem, switch it over to be just a basic modem, reboot it, and just like that outbound ssh worked again. The first two support representatives met my expectations, the third exceeded them. I should probably have higher expectations for Mediacom, but here we are. </p>
<p>I’m glad to have everything working again. Not being able to clone repositories using the standard git+ssh protocol was really cramping my style. Hopefully I won’t have to change anything about this setup I’ve got now for a few more years. I suppose the next thing I look into will probably be ipv6.  </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2018-03-04-aws_dropbox.html'>Dropbox and AWS</a></h2>
<p>Dropbox apparently saved a boatload of money by moving their infrastructure off of AWS and building out their own data centers. Taken at face value this might seem like a strike against AWS, but the way I see it this was the only way Dropbox was going to be able to differentiate themselves as a service. Their job is to provide cloud storage, something AWS can do easily, but if that’s the only thing you are getting from AWS, it’s going to cost an arm and a leg. This news once again got me thinking about the industry as a whole, my place in it, and how I think about cloud services. </p>
<p>If you've been in the technology industry for a while it's easy to think about cloud services like AWS as just another data center. A place where you can spin up a new virtual machine and manage your server instance just like you would if you were racking hardware or using VMWare. AWS will happily let you do that, but you'll be missing out on the advantages that thinking about the cloud as a development platform offers.  </p>
<p>The biggest innovation from AWS is that you only ever pay for what you use. Compare this with managing a data center, where you have to purchase enough hardware to handle peak utilization for the next several years, and then watch as your investment sits mostly underutilized for most of the time. You also have to make an educated guess about expansion for the next few years. Did you buy enough storage? How about memory? Will you need to purchase more in the future? How much of an interruption will that be if you do? Cloud services take care of all of that by only providing what's needed when you need it, as long as you take advantage of what the platform offers.   </p>
<p>Over the years I’ve noticed a trend towards more simplification in the systems that I build and design. In general, the fewer moving parts in a system the better. It will be more reliable, and easier to troubleshoot when something does go wrong. Unfortunately, I’ve also watched as the industry went in the opposite direction, building card houses out of frameworks and management systems barely out of their infancy. It may be that I’m jaded by my experience, or it may be that I’m just a grumpy old man, but whenever I hear about someone building out a Kubernates infrastructure to run their Docker containers in the cloud I get the suspicion that someone along the way got a case of the <em>clevers</em>[^1]. Is that necessary? Is it <em>really</em>?  </p>
<p>I should specify that the fewer moving parts in my part of the systems I build the better. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft undoubtedly have several layers of gears running their underlying systems, but the trick here is that they use those same layers for thousands of customers running millions of workloads. For example, my favored system uses very small instances in an autoscaling group to automatically add and remove capacity as needed to reflect the ebb and flow of normal business traffic. If sales sends out a big promotional email, the system will recognize the increase in traffic and spin up enough instances behind the load balancer to be able to handle it. When traffic dies back down, the system terminates the additional instances. All transparently behind the scenes. The configuration for the build is simple enough, and the documentation for what each component does is straight-forward. What’s more, Amazon themselves use the same systems to build out higher level services. </p>
<p>Growing your instance size or changing it’s type is also a simple matter. If the base size is too small or too big, a simple adjustment to the CloudFormation template will automatically create a new instance, deploy the latest revision to the application to it, and shut down the old one. Building on the massive scale of AWS, it’s virtually guaranteed that you’ll never run out of resources. Also, unlike hardware in a data center, Amazon’s instances tend to get both <em>faster</em> and <em>less expensive</em> with each new release. Simply upgrading your instance type can save time and money.</p>
<p>For a lot of business out there that aren’t Dropbox, AWS can provide you a path to simplification of your infrastructure where you can build up secure, scaleable, and cost effective environment. If this sounds appealing, but you need someone to handle the complexity for you, get in touch, maybe we should talk.</p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2018-02-21-A_New_macOS.html'>A New macOS</a></h2>
<p>I've heard several people on podcasts or blog posts claim that they'd like to see Apple hold off on new features that nobody wants and just fix the existing bugs in the Mac. This claim is normally followed up with a missive that they can't imagine what Apple could add to the Mac at this point anyway, since macOS is a stable, mature operating system. Well, I can think of a few things.</p>
<p>Let's start with the Mac's management of information. There is, supposedly, artificial intelligence baked into the Mac in the form of <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3088224/macs/how-to-use-siri-on-macos-sierra.html">Siri</a>, an AI assistant that is supposed to be able to answer questions and perform basic tasks. Basic, as in "far too basic". I've yet to find a way that the AI actually helps me get anything done. Siri has hooks into all of the built-in apps that manage my information: Notes, Contacts, Reminders, Calendar, Mail, Spotlight, and the file system, but doesn't help me find relevant information unless I specifically ask her for it. What if Siri could suggest additionally relevant information with a simple swipe of the trackpad? The "Today" view in the Mac's right-hand sidebar would be a perfect place to show relevant files, folders, emails, contacts, notes, or tasks based on textual analysis and AI.</p>
<p>If you have an email selected in Mail, you could swipe over from the right and see a list of other information related to that email. Likewise if you select an event in Calendar, or a Note, etc… Eagle-eyed readers will most likely note the similarities between my suggestion and the fantastic <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html">DEVONthink</a>. That's no accident. I've felt for a long time that the AI at the core of DEVONthink would be spectacular if built into macOS. In DEVONthink, selecting a file and clicking on their little top hat icon will show you a list of related documents and suggest an appropriate group, or folder, for the document. I'd like to see the Mac <a href="https://www.cocoanetics.com/2011/06/on-getting-sherlocked/">sherlock</a> that bit of functionality and expand it to the entire system.</p>
<p>Speaking of things that should be system-wide, how about tags? I suggest the next version of macOS come with the ability to tag everything. Let's put tags in notes, todos, calendar events, contacts… the entire suite of productivity apps built into the Mac. The whole shebang, as they say. And, to be clear, let's make sure they are the same tags, not siloed tags unique per application. That wouldn't be nearly as useful in the big macOS data soup. </p>
<p>Next, you know how Apple bought the iOS app "Workflow"? How about we stop messing around and ship Hazel as a built-in part of the Mac. It already fits right in, running invisibly in the background and acting on rules set in the preference pane. Of course, if Apple bought it we could put rules for everything in Hazel. We could have Hazel triggering rules not just for files and folders, but for Mail, Calendar, Reminders… <a href="https://youtu.be/vZYlhShD2oQ?t=150">are you getting it</a>?</p>
<p>Finally, let's build in real security into every part of the Mac. I suggest private key encryption for everything before it is sync'd off of the machine. Transmitting files over SSL is fine. Storing files on the server on an encrypted disk is also fine. However, the files themselves are not encrypted, which means (as I understand it) that if the iCloud server is running the files are available. The encryption on the server just means that if someone tried to run off with the hard drive they couldn't get into it. That's why you can get to them from the web. Your login to icloud.com does not unencrypt the files, it simply allows you access to them. End-to-end private key encryption would be the next step that Apple could take to ensure that their customer's information is safe and secure, even when transmitted across the Internet. </p>
<p>The purpose of a computer is to be a <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/12/21/steve-jobs-bicycle-for-the-mind-1990/">bicycle for the mind</a>, a way to not only manage information, but help you make better decisions, cook better meals, make better deals, build better software, write better papers. Whatever you do, a computer should seamlessly help you do it better, and get out of your way to let you do it.</p>
<p>If the Mac is the pickup truck, <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/12/cars-and-trucks-and-mac-suvs/">or SUV</a>, of the computing world, and the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/12/future_of_the_mac_in_an_ios_world">heaviness of macOS</a> is what lets iOS stay light, then my suggestion is to lean into that philosophy and make the Mac the absolute best tool for managing information. A professional grade tool for professional daily use. And, obviously, since this is us, do it with <em>style</em>.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2017-12-07-The_Future_of_DevOps_is_AI.html'>The Future of DevOps is AI</a></h2>
<p>The work of systems administration, that is, racking new hardware, running cables, and loading operating systems, is quickly becoming eclipsed by devops. Servers come from the factory ready to rack, and the base operating system has become nearly meaningless in the context of running applications thanks to Docker. All you need is a baseline Linux install, the specifics of what each application needs to run are taken care of inside the Docker container. </p>
<p>If you are running your workloads in the cloud[^1], the need for a dedicated sysadmin is even more redundant[^2], since both the hardware and the base operating system are outsourced to AWS, Microsoft, or Google. However, bridging the gap between deploying applications to production and writing the application code sits devops, which for the past several years has been a fantastic opportunity for sysadmins to branch out into new and interesting ways. That opportunity is not going to last forever though. The core tasks of a devops engineer are repeatable, and the current complexity that devops now handles is moving more and more towards simplification.</p>
<p>In devops, there is a starting point, a set of tasks, and a specific end goal to achieve. Primarily, a devops engineer will take code from a repository and build out the systems to test and deploy that code to production in a secure, scaleable environment. That’s what I do anyway. History tells us that any repeatable, programmable task will be automated by a machine sooner or later, and I think we are starting to see what those new machines will look like. </p>
<p>Jason Kottke <a href="https://kottke.org/17/12/googles-ai-beats-the-worlds-top-chess-engine-w-only-4-hours-of-practice">posted a link</a> to Chess.com earlier today about how Google’s AlphaZero AI became the best chess player in history in four hours. It wasn’t loaded with a chess program, the AI taught itself how to play, and became unbeatable. Putting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=skynet+terminator">Skynet theories</a> temporarily aside, how big of a step is it from there to automating devops? An AI could be trained on Github, given AWS or GAE as a deployment ground, and given an end goal of each application up and running. </p>
<p>Programmer friends who I floated this idea to in the past had mixed replies. Some claimed that the AI necessary to do this would be beyond anything currently in our capabilities. Others said that it <em>might</em> be possible. I think the writing on the wall is clear. It is possible, and I imagine it’s only a matter of time before the big three cloud providers each deploy their own version of automatic code deployment. It won’t look like much from outside, the only configuration they’ll need is access to your repository, and the AI will build up everything else necessary. </p>
<p>The models exist, the artificial intelligence exists, and the need for the service exists. DevOps is a career path with an expiration date. If that date is 10, 20, or 30 years down the road, I can’t tell, but it’s closer than any of us working in the industry would care to consider. </p>
<p>[^1]:   Which you really should be.</p>
<p>[^2]:   Well, that is <em>if</em> you are running your applications in the cloud the way the cloud was meant to be used.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2017-11-22-Using_a_Mac.html'>What's a Computer?</a></h2>
<p>I've been enjoying watching the new iPad commercial of a kid and her iPad roaming around the city. Two things come to mind. First, is this what it's like for kids in the city? Having never lived in one myself I find it fascinating that she just roams around, takes the bus, hangs out in an alley, whatever. Second, and more important, is what she's doing with that iPad. </p>
<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3S5BLs51yDQ?si=duypFTZNDpx614HB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>The first time we see her with the iPad she’s chatting with a friend over FaceTime, snaps a screenshot, and draws on it. She shows the screenshot to her friend, then sends a copy of it over Messages. Next she’s in an alley with a bunch of furniture, sitting in a seat and twisted to her left to type on the iPad keyboard. She notices a praying mantis on a leaf next to her and quickly snaps a photo, dropping that picture into what looks like a Pages document about bugs in the city. We see her typing in a bakery, drawing in a tree, and reading a comic on the bus. Finally, she’s laying in the grass in her backyard typing again, and when her neighbor asks her what she’s doing on her computer, she replies “what’s a computer?”</p>
<p>We’ll put to the side the ridiculousness of that question, as we the viewer are supposed to assume that the next generation is going to grow up using the tablet form factor and will have no idea what a classic desktop computer is. It’s a stretch, but ok. The commercial calls back to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_pMx7IjYKE">previous iPad video</a> that shows people working in different ways in different occupations using an iPad Pro. In the previous video they use the camera to capture and analyze athletic performance, they type and draw, share building schematics, and use the iPad in place of printed technical manuals. Both commercials point to the type of lifestyle and <em>work-style</em> that Apple believes the iPad is best suited for. </p>
<p>In no video does it show a developer sitting at his desk for eight hours a day starting at the screen and trying his level best to edit code, ssh into servers, and manage his git repositories. All things that are technically possible on an iPad Pro, but not <em>better</em> than they are on a Mac. A few months ago I bought an iPad Pro, Smart Keyboard, and Pencil and attempted to work only using it. The experience was very similar to using a laptop. The screen was small, and I wound up hunched over my desk for several hours a day struggling through tasks that were second nature on the Mac. Before my two-weeks were up, I wound up returning the iPad and getting my money back. I bought a 27” iMac instead, <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/imac-two-months-in/">and it’s been fantastic</a>. </p>
<p>However, the experience made me think about what kind of work I do and how I don’t want to get stuck in the past while the world moves on around me. There’s a thin line between waiting for the technology to mature to the point where you can use it without <em>stress</em>, and growing stagnant. There is a fairly good chance that many new developers in the next ten years might not have worked on anything but an iPad, depending on if they got one issued to them in school or not. I want to be able to move to the new technology when it’s ready for me, but judging when it’s ready might not be something I can do objectively, but I think we can lay some ground rules. </p>
<p><strong>The iPad needs to be able to connect to an external monitor and trackpad.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I can hear the “but it’s a touch interface” objections from here. To answer that I’d like to point at the current iOS feature to 3D press on the keyboard to move the cursor in a text field. Like Jason Snell has argued, they’ve already given us a mouse-like interface, why not take it all the way? It’s probably healthier to move around all day like the kid in the video, but there are a whole lot of us who have a desk they sit at every day, and the iPad is simply poorly ergonomically designed for long periods of work. </p>
<p><strong>The iPad needs to be able to run a full suite of Unix tools.</strong></p>
<p>So much of my development work happens in Terminal.app. For example, in one of our applications we need to run a <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> app that uses a ssh tunnel to a MySQL server, and then be able to load the Django site by browsing to localhost on a particular port. One could argue that if <em>that’s</em> the kind of work you are doing, you should just use a Mac. I’d argue that loosening of the iPad restrictions <em>just a bit</em> would open the device up to an entirely new class of user. They don’t need to give full access to the Unix underpinnings of iOS to provide a Unix development environment, they could chroot the user in a sandbox. It’s technically possible, but not currently possible. </p>
<p><strong>The iPad needs a local and remote backup solution.</strong></p>
<p>I worry about my data. Too much, obviously. My Mac runs the classic <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/">3-2-1 backup system</a> (three copies of your data, two local, one remote). iCloud backup could work, but a local Time Machine would be even better. Being able to restore just one file to what it was an hour ago is, at times, priceless. I’d say we are probably closest to having this, depending on the app you are using, but a system-wide, effortless, file-level backup and recovery system would be fantastic.[^1] </p>
<p>I may be able to switch to an iPad before all these three things happen, but it would be so cumbersome and difficult that my work would suffer as a result.</p>
<p>What I don’t want to do is jump on the “it’s not a real computer” bandwagon. That’s the same argument that was used against Macs for years, back when my Mac was the only one in the company outside of design. The Mac was derided for years as an expensive toy by IT departments and PC enthusiasts. They were wrong then, and those saying it’s impossible to get any real work done on an iPad now are wrong. What I’m saying is that <em>for now</em>, it’s impractical for me to use an iPad for every day work, but I don’t think it’ll stay that way forever. For now, there simply is no alternative to the command line to do what I do. In the future, that might not be the case. </p>
<p>I’ve found it interesting to look at how work was done before computers became commonplace. Writers used typewriters, which served as the models for how computers first evolved, but I think the more interesting occupation to look at is that of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_board">architect working at a drafting table</a> or a drawing board. They might have done some sketching or taken down some ideas in a notebook, but the real work happened with an expansive canvas in an environment that was conducive to long periods of uninterrupted work. </p>
<p>The iPad Pro right now is a professional notebook. I’m waiting for it to be a drafting table, something similar to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/10/26/13380462/microsoft-surface-studio-pc-computer-announced-features-price-release-date">Microsoft Surface Studio</a>, but without the suck. </p>
<p>[^1]:   I know, the iPad isn’t supposed to worry about “files”, but then again it does have a Files app now, so I’d say that argument also went out the window. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2017-11-09-Veterans_Day.html'>Veterans Day</a></h2>
<p>I gave a talk at our school Veterans Day assembly today. I didn't get everything I wanted to say in, but it seemed to go over well. </p>
<p>So, I thought an awful lot about what I wanted to say to you today. What message I could bring that would be of use to middle schoolers, and I want to talk to you about why you might want to consider joining the Navy after high school. Now, I’m not a recruiter, I’m not here to sell you some schickt or a bunch of meaningless jargon. I want to tell you what the Navy did for me, and what it could do for you too. </p>
<p>I joined the Navy when I was 18 in 1995, which probably seems like absolute ages ago to all of you, but it seem like yesterday to me. I was a rambunctious kid, bit of a troublemaker, you might say. And for me, at the time, college was simply not in the cards. I knew I needed to do something with my life, but I didn’t know what it was. I wanted to travel, and my dad was in the Navy when he was young and he went all over the world, so it sounded like a good idea for me too. </p>
<p>So, I signed up and shipped off to boot camp in Great Lakes, IL in October, graduated in December. After boot camp, I went to engineering common core, then I shipped off to San Diego for “A” school where I learned to be a machinist. </p>
<p>After San Diego I was assigned to the USS Platte, an oiler. We were a floating Caseys, a gas station for all the other Navy ships in the sea. We would pull along side another ship, the gunners mates would fire lines across to them, they’d pull the lines tight, and we’d run big hoses over to the other ship. </p>
<p>Then we’d just steam across the Atlantic pumping millions of gallons of gas over to the other ship. That was our job. </p>
<p>I went on two Mediterranean deployments during the three years I lived on the ship for six months each. During the deployments I visited Portugal, Spain, Gibraltar, France, Italy (spent a lot of time in Italy), Greece, and even went to Israel once. Back stateside we went to the Bahamas and the Virgin Islands once, and north to Nova Scotia once too. That was a blast, you can ask Mrs. Buys about that, she was there for that one!</p>
<p>Back then, and remember this was in the ‘90s, it was peace time, and we were an oilier, so keep that in mind, but we’d go from port to port, spending a week or two underway before pulling into port in another country for a few days. We’d get maybe a day to go explore wherever we were, sometimes go on an MWR trip or something. But, it was a blast, but it was also a lot of hard work. When you’re underway, there’s nothing better to do than to learn everything you can about the ship. And play cards. We played a lot of cards.</p>
<p>I got to travel, I learned that I loved the ocean, I was a firefighter on the ship, and I worked hard and became a radioman. It was an experience I’ll never forget. </p>
<p>After the ship I was transferred to a small joint-services command in rural England, six hours West of London in Cornwall called JMF St. Mawgan. This was a shore command that counted as sea duty for ship-shore rotation because it was so remote, but it was amazing. The Navy shipped our family over, and our Jeep, and we rented a farmhouse right outside a tiny little village. What we did there was… classified, and I was never sure if it was ever unclassified, so, we’ll just move on. I was a radioman and handled communications. The facility itself was underground in a building built to withstand a nuclear bomb. There were armed British guards at a big turnstile, then a long concrete tunnel, then you’d turn and it was another long concrete tunnel, then you’d come to a massive red 50 ton door, then a decontamination station, and then you would be in what was basically an office building. </p>
<p>We loved rural England so much we stayed an extra year. I spent four years there total, and it was another fantastic experience I’ll never forget. I was in England on 9/11. When everything changed. That’s a story for a different day. </p>
<p>Eventually, my tour in the UK came to an end and I had to move once again, this time the Navy shipped me all the way from lush green England to the high desert of Albuquerque, NM, where I was assigned to another special duty command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, which used to be the Defense Nuclear Agency. We built bombs, and they sent me every now and then up to the desert in Nevada north of Las Vegas to handle communications for testing these bombs. The base in Las Vegas was an Air Force base sectioned off into different areas that numbered up into the 50s.</p>
<p>After three years at DTRA, the Navy told me it was time for me to go back out to sea again. At this point, I had to stop and take stock of where I was in life. </p>
<p>I had joined the Navy 11 years prior with nothing but the shirt on my back. I was leaving with a family, a home, and the skills and confidence to build a career on. I looked at my young family and thought about all the long months out to sea and being apart from them, and decided that at this point I’d served my time, so I chose not to reenlist, and was honorably discharged in October of ’06. </p>
<p>This was meant to be a really short overview of my time in the Navy, but what I’d like for you to take out of it is that while I did work hard, harder than I ever thought possible for me, I also had some of the best times of my life in the Navy, and had experiences and went places that I never would have been able to otherwise. Navy life is unlike any other military service, or any other job. </p>
<p>Speaking of jobs, </p>
<p>No matter what kind of job you are thinking of going into when you grow up, there’s an equivalent in the Navy. The Navy is a microcosm of the United States, there’s people from all walks of life in the Navy. If you want to be a plumber, there’s a job for that. Computer programmer? There’s a job for that. Doctor? Yep. Mechanic, you bet! Construction? Absolutely, we call them the Seabees. </p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, when you sign that dotted line to enlist in the Navy you are putting your life on the line. The shipboard environment is hazardous, and our ships are targets for our enemies. I’ve made, and lost, the best friends of my life in the Navy, and I’ve had friends who’ve suffered debilitating injuries. Life on the ocean is for the brave. </p>
<p>Being a sailor is an old service with old traditions. The Navy needs sailors to man the ships, and the ships of the United States Navy make up the most massive display of military power the world has ever known. It was an honor to be part of it. But more than that, more than flag waving and patriotism, if you want to be pragmatic about starting your life out on the right foot, the Navy is unique. You travel and serve, you do what you’re told when you’re told to do it. You learn just how hard you can work, you learn how to deal with emergencies and life-threatening situations. You learn, by pushing yourself further than you think you can go and rising to the occasion, just how deep your strength really goes. </p>
<p>I joined the Navy in 1995 with literally no possessions but the shirt on my back. I left eleven years later with a family, a home, and a profitable career path. Not everything has been roses and unicorns, but thanks be to my savior Jesus, I’m blessed more than I have any right to be. I owe that to the Navy. When I enlisted I signed a dotted line that I was willing to lay down my life for my country, but at the time the only country I was thinking of was a country of one… me. But what I learned in the Navy was that I wasn’t putting my life on the line for myself, I was doing it for my shipmates, for my family, for my kids. I put my life on the line because the country that let a dirt poor troublemaker from a Montana reservation rise up the ranks to be a respectable homeowner is worth defending. Because in America, where you were born does not dictate who you have to be. Your family name, your race, your checking account balance… none of that matters more than how hard you decide to work. You can wallow in your disadvantages, or you can rise above them. In America, you are not born who you were meant to be, you make your own destiny. </p>
<p>Do we have problems? You bet we do. Big ones. But you can’t help solve them until you solve your own. You might find yourself someday in the same position I was at 18. Listless, restless, no direction. In that case I hope you remember this, that I was once like you, and what worked for me, might work for you too. </p>
<p>And along the way you might find the best friends you’ve ever had, you might meet the love of your life, and you just might find a deep sense of patriotism that goes beyond waving a flag or slapping an eagle sticker on your bumper. I joined the Navy for selfish reasons, what I learned was that we did what we did for each other. For the man or woman standing next to me holding the line, fighting the fire. To keep the people we love safe, to maintain our way of life, a veteran put his life on the line.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2017-11-08-imac-two-months-in.html'>Two Months With iMac Prime</a></h2>
<p>The 27” iMac 5K is unquestionably the best computer I’ve ever owned. After two months of daily use, for twelve to fourteen hours per day, I can say without reservation that this machine is fantastic. Obviously, I’m late to the bandwagon on this, better reviews than what I would write <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2014/10/review-27-inch-imac-with-retina-5k-display/">have</a> <a href="https://www.imore.com/retina-5k-imac-review">already</a> <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2842025/mac-computers/review-imac-with-retina-5k-display-is-among-apple-s-brightest-lights.html">been</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/the-27-inch-imac-with-retina-5k-display/">written</a>, and although those reviews are from 2014, they hold up well enough for the 2017 upgrade too. The screen is beautiful, like a massive glossy magazine. The machine is fast enough so I <em>nearly</em> never have to wait. Basically, it’s everything I need from a computer. </p>
<h3>What I Love</h3>
<p>Having a desktop computer that is always on has benefits. My mail rules always sort my inbox. I have SuperDuper! setup to automatically clone my internal drive every weekday after Energy Saver wakes it up. The internal SSD is big enough that I’ve got all of my data downloaded and stored locally. </p>
<p>The iMac survived <em>The Great Port Purge</em> so far. So on the back of my screen I’ve got all the connections I need, including four standard USB ports and an SD Card slot for my camera. Three of the USB ports are taken up by my ScanSnap scanner, my time machine backup drive, and the SuperDuper! clone drive. The fourth is open for when I need to charge an accessory. </p>
<p>The two drives are held up by a <a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/product/backpack-for-imac">Twelve South Backpack</a> so they are out of the way and I don’t have to see any cable mess. That keeps my desk clean and my fussy mind focused. </p>
<p>In many ways I feel like the iMac is the last computer that Apple is shipping that’s not compromised to the point of suffering usability, reliability, or both. </p>
<p>The latest Magic Keyboard is great. Like others who’ve become accustomed to the new style of keyboards, every other kind of keyboard now feels like a mushy mess to me. This new one is crisp and precise. </p>
<h3>What Could Be Better</h3>
<p>Using the Magic Trackpad 2 is not the same as using the trackpad on a MacBook. I’ve had a hard time dragging things from one spot to another, like if I want to drag something from my desktop to a folder. I’ll click with one finger, then start dragging with another, and for some reason sometimes that drag just doesn’t happen. This might be a combination of a new Mac and a new operating system, it might be because I haven’t gotten the feel for it yet, but whatever the problem, it’s been frustrating. </p>
<p>The screen is so big that it takes more than one operation to move a file from one spot to another. That sounds like the firstiest of first-world problems, but it’s a real enough issue that I broke out my old mouse at one point. I’m still getting used to the trackpad, but so far my opinion of it has not been high. Perhaps it will improve with use. The multitouch gestures like five-finger swipe to show the desktop work well on the large trackpad, where the MacBook trackpad was always too small, and swiping from the edge to show the Notification Center works well, as does swiping to go back and forward in Safari. It’s a mixed bag. </p>
<p>This Saturday I’m packing up the iMac and bringing it to the Apple Store for repairs. I found a big, ugly, dead pixel center-right of the screen. When it’s up against a white background, like this text editor, it looks like a speck of dirt and I  feel like I should wipe it off. But, it doesn’t go anywhere. So, although I’m loath to have anyone crack the seal on the Mac, I can’t go though the next several years staring at this dot. </p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>If you, like me, spend a significant amount of time in front of a computer, I can’t recommend the iMac highly enough. It’s a beautiful work of art, designed to live in your home or office, and it’s also a powerful workhorse that can keep up with the most demanding tasks. It’s hard for me to recommend any other Mac in the Apple lineup right now to anyone but early adopters or those with enough technical savvy to work around the MacBook and MacBook Pro limitations. I’m hoping in another revision they’ll have some of the issues with the keyboard worked out, and maybe even throw in an extra port or two[^1]. For me, this iMac is exactly what I need.</p>
<p>[^1]:   Not likely. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2017-10-27-favorite-things-about-fall.html'>My Favorite Things About Fall 🍁🍂</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.relay.fm/topfour">Top Four</a> is one of my favorite podcasts. Possibly my number one, although its probably tied with <a href="http://atp.fm">ATP</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a>. It’s a strong contender. Marco and Tif Arment chat about some random group of things, and attempt to rank said things, usually failing because they can’t make up their minds. It’s adorable. It’s clear that the two of them are having a good time, and listening always makes me laugh. </p>
<p>In a recent episode the pair ranked their top four favorite “Fall-tivities”, things to do in the Fall. They named a few things I’d never heard of, like pumpkin blazing, which sounds like a lot of fun, and talked about the corn mazes in the Northeast, which for some reason sound bigger than ours here in Iowa. A travesty if true. </p>
<p>Listening to the podcast put me in the holiday mood early this year, and since it’s good to think about good things that make us happy, here, in no particular order, here are a few of my favorite things about Fall. </p>
<ul>
<li>Flannels, sweaters, and jackets</li>
<li>Getting a chill outside and coming inside to warm up under a blanket with a hot drink</li>
<li>Apple pie</li>
<li>The smell of cinnamon and spice in the air when baking said apple pie</li>
<li>Also pumpkin pie</li>
<li>Pumpkins on peoples porches</li>
<li>The leaves changing color and falling</li>
<li>The holiday season is coming, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years 🎁🎉🎊</li>
<li>Getting up before the sun comes up and going outside to look at the stars</li>
<li>Soups, stews, and chili</li>
<li>Smores in the backyard over a fire, just because. </li>
<li>Football and Fall soccer seasons</li>
<li>The long, hot, miserable summer is over. The seasons change, life goes on. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fall is by far my favorite time of the year. The grass stops growing, but we don’t have snow yet. The days get shorter, but there’s still plenty of sunshine. Time to break out the gloves and hats and scarves. Time to bake some cookies and carve a pumpkin. Run a little later in the day, and enjoy it more because the temperature is perfect for running in long sleeves. Go for a hayride, have a bonfire, dig the decorations out of storage. Put our petty differences aside and remember that we are all neighbors. Give, laugh, love. Fall is the best. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2017-09-29-The_City_Museum.html'>The City Museum</a></h2>
<p>I'm in St. Louis for the <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com">Strange Loop conference</a>, and the conference kicked off last night with a party at the <a href="https://www.citymuseum.org">City Museum</a>. I didn't bother to look into the museum much before I came. A few friends told me a bit about it, but it wasn't enough for me to really understand what the museum was; the City Museum isn't a museum, its a mad amusement park. </p>
<p>I heard from another conference attendee who'd been there before that the museum was the product of a single person's desire to make something out of an abandoned building. A mad genius. I describe exploring the museum like going through someone else's code… you're always finding things that make no sense. Why is there an airplane on scaffolding outside? Why are there two? Why is the only way to get to the plane through a maze of metal steps and tunnels? Why is the basement built to look like an underground cave? From the insect display to the collection of Italian movie posters to the human-sized hamster wheel, the City Museum makes no sense. It's an eclectic collection of amusing things. Five stories of collected randomness. </p>
<p>My friend fulfilled a lifelong dream of falling into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_pit">ball pool</a>. There was a live band playing on the first floor, board games on the second, food and drinks on the third, and mazes everywhere. There are two massive bank vault doors connected to a hall of mirrors that leads back to the hamster wheel. There are statues of whales, gorgon heads in a fountain, HO scale model train with flying dragons breathing fire, stairs that don't lead anywhere and slides that go for several stories. </p>
<p>I'm not sure how "safe" the museum is, or how it manages insurance. The structures I climbed on all seemed sturdy enough, but I did wonder at times how old they were, or when the last time they were inspected was. My original plan was to walk to the museum, grab some food for dinner, and walk back to the hotel, mainly ignoring the festivities and the museum. I'm glad I stayed for a few hours.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2017-08-29-Running_Again.html'>Running Again</a></h2>
<p>At the beginning of Spring, I signed up for two races, the half-marathon <a href="http://damtodam.com">Dam to Dam</a> in the summer, and the full Des Moines Marathon in October. This was my second half, but I'd never come close to a full marathon, so signing up for it was aspirational motivation. I was training with a group running long on Saturday mornings, so as the time for the half approached and I started thinking about the full, I was feeling more and more confident that I would actually be able to run it. Then I ran the half, and things went wrong. </p>
<p>It was hot. Not ridiculously so, but it started out in the 70s and went up from there. I probably would have been fine, but I wore my long Under Armor pants under my shorts, mistake number one. I started out at a good pace, but too good, running at around 8:30 or so, which for me is pretty fast, even when I'm at peak training. Mistake number two. The first few miles were fine, but around mile four or so the sun beating down started to take its toll. I stopped at every water station to take a drink. Around mile six I started taking an extra cup to pour on my head. Mistake number three. </p>
<p>Mile seven I hit The Wall. I hit it far too early, I was only halfway done. The water I had been dunking on my head soaked my shirt, which started chafing and I started to bleed. I was absolutely ready to quit. I saw quite a few other folks on the side of the road who'd given up or pushed themselves too hard and collapsed, needing medical attention. I'd stop and walk, then jog, then walk, then jog, pushing and pushing to get through the race. It was a struggle. It was hard. I was miserable. </p>
<p>Some days I can get out and knock down ten miles and feel great during and after the run. Sure, I'll feel exhausted, my legs will feel tired, I'll be breathing heavy, but inside I'll still have energy, I'll still have that spark of joy that makes running worthwhile. At the Dam to Dam, I lost that spark. I dragged myself across the finish line, got my finishers medal and went to find my friends I drove up with. While they agreed that the run had been one of the worst, they had finished far in front of me. It felt like my months of training had all gone out the window. I thought about the full marathon in the Fall, but the seed of hope that I'd fostered during the training leading up to the half was gone. </p>
<p>The week after the half I ran a local 10K, finishing first in my age group  (being the only one in my age group), and then started training on my own for the marathon. I was on mile six of a ten-mile run when I gave up. My run out was great, my run back turned into the same kind of slog I experienced in the half, and what was left of my resolve to keep running dissolved. I went home and told my wife I was done. She thought it was probably the best thing for my knees. </p>
<p>My wife and I joined an early morning workout class, and I realized that all my running had done little for my overall health. The women in this class were out-punching, out-kicking, and out-squat-jumping me through the entire class. I'd built up endurance, but my overall strength and physical ability had floundered. This class kicked my ass.</p>
<p>At first, it actually felt great not to have a long weekend run to be anxious about during the week. I slept in on Saturday, had too big of a breakfast, and generally loafed around the house. I was getting into the workout class two to three times per week, so why not? Over the weeks that followed I slowly started noticing something in myself. I was more agitated, I became frustrated more easily. Something was wrong. Missing.</p>
<p>While the workout class pushed me physically in ways that I was not accustomed to, the loud pounding music and group environment didn't allow me the quiet, personal time that was the primary reason I ran in the first place. What was missing was the meditative experience running provides, the feeling of doing something by yourself, for yourself, where you can literally run away from everything for an hour.</p>
<p>I quit running because I forgot why I ran in the first place. I'd had a bad run and thrown in the towel, and this created two problems for me. For one, I was missing out on the benefits to my mental health. Running helps me put everything in life in perspective, it gives me goals to work towards, it clears my mind. Secondly, I gave up on something I said I was going to do, which I felt violated my personal integrity. I noticed that whenever I thought about the marathon I felt, <em>bad</em>. A tinge of guilt. The same feeling I get when I think about my failed software company, Farmdog. I'd given up on something that I am. <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/A_Runner/">I'm a runner</a>. </p>
<p>I can't have that. </p>
<p>I decided to start running again after reading an article in <a href="https://www.scribd.com/article/355869451/Embrace-The-Tough-Stuff">Runners World</a> about pushing through the hard things in life. The author said, paraphrasing, that we run <em>because</em> it's hard. When we overcome the hard runs it prepares us to overcome whatever other difficulties life throws at us. </p>
<p>This morning I strapped on my phone, put on a podcast, and had the Nike app track a 20-minute run. I'm easing my way back into the habit, but with fresh eyes and a new habit to mix into my runs. I'm keeping up pretty good with the rest of the crew at our morning kickboxing workout now. Although there are some workouts where I'm ready to quit after 15 minutes, by the time we hit the 45-minute mark I'm feeling pretty good. I'm positive that the workouts will help with an overall total-body approach to health, but I'm going back to the road for my mind. I'm too late to start training for the full marathon this year, but I'm not giving up. I'm just saying, "not yet". I'm still a runner.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2017-07-07-Serverless_Jekyll_Hosting_on_AWS.html'>Serverless Jekyll Hosting on AWS</a></h2>
<p>This is a bit silly, I’ll be the first to admit. The contraption I’ve built to host this site is clearly unnecessary, especially when I could host the site on <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github</a> for free, with very little effort, but I was curious, so down the rabbit hole I went. </p>
<p>I thought it would be interesting to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html">host my site on S3</a>. The site is entirely static,  no database back end or dynamic programming required to generate the site, it’s just HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also wanted to understand the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/">AWS CodeBuild</a> service, and how I might be able to use it for other projects. </p>
<p>There are four components of this system: Github, which hosts the code for the state. The domain name is registered and managed through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">Route53</a>, where I’ve configured an “A” record as an alias to point at the S3 bucket which hosts the site. Finally, CodeBuild is the glue which pulls the code from Github, runs <code>jekyll build</code>, and pushes the site to S3. </p>
<p>CodeBuild works by starting a Docker container and pulling the repository down. It then looks for a file named <code>buildspec.yml</code> which contains the instructions to build the project. This file contains arbitrary Linux commands, whatever you need to build your code. Mine looks something like this:</p>
<p>{% highlight yaml %}
version: 0.2</p>
<p>env:
  variables:
SITEBUILD: "yes"
phases:
  install:
commands:
apt-get update -y
  pre_build:
commands:
gem install bundler
    bundle install
  build:
commands:
echo Build started on date
    bundle exec jekyll build
    aws s3 sync _site/ s3://jonathanbuys.com
  post_build:
commands:
echo Build completed on date
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>The interesting thing about this system is that I could replace Jekyll with <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>, or any other static site generator, even my own scripts, and the system would stay the same. I’d just need to update <code>buildspec.yml</code> with the new commands to install the right tools and build the site. Hosting costs so far have been pennies, my cost this month <em>might</em> reach $1.27, and for the past couple months the cost has been below one dollar. </p>
<p>I’ve been considering making this system more user friendly and monetizing it somehow. There’s a business model to be had in here somewhere, if I care to pursue it. Even though blogging in general appears to be in somewhat of a decline, publishing platforms will always be needed. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2017-05-24-Recommending_a_New_Mac.html'>Recommending a New Mac</a></h2>
<p>I got an email from my mom the other day asking me for a recommendation on a new Mac. The first question I asked was what her budget was like. She said she’d like to keep it under a grand, which right away narrowed the field quite a bit. Next I asked what she would be using the machine for, to which she replied with the standard home use cases of “income taxes, email, scanning, internet, etc”, as well as printing to a Brother ink jet. </p>
<p>At first glance, it would seem like she would be the perfect candidate for an iPad. Modest computing needs, tight budget, and she doesn’t want junk. Or, in her words, “I hate slow computers but don't need top of the line either.” I considered steering her towards an iPad, but that first item in the list of things she uses a computer for gave me pause, “income taxes”. I don’t know exactly what software she uses to do taxes, but I started imagining scenarios where she would run up against the edges of what the iPad, or more specifically, iOS, can do. Would she need to download and import files from banks? Would she need to read files off a USB drive? She’s into wildlife photography in Montana, how would she get the photos on the iPad?[^1] My mom’s no slouch, but she’s not <a href="https://www.macstories.net/tag/ipad-diaries/">Federico Viticci</a> either. Pushing the boundaries of iOS is not what she cares to be spending her time doing. </p>
<p>I imagine Mom just wants to use a computer like she’s been doing for the past thirty years. Given the budget, and after eliminating the iPad from the equation, I briefly considered the desktop options. Of course, all of those were thrown out almost immediately. The iMacs are too expensive, the Mac Mini is too slow, and the Mac Pro, uh, no. That leads us to the laptop line. The MacBook Adorable was considered, then eliminated for lack of ports and high price. The new MacBook Pro also suffers from a lack of standard ports and a price tag that’s far too high. That leaves us with the venerable MacBook Air.</p>
<p>The Air has been Apple’s best laptop, and possibly best computer period, for years. While the MacBook Pro is the workhorse of the lineup, the Air’s svelte styling and weight paired with an affordable price tag to make an extremely compelling offer. While the MacBook Adorbs is beautiful and portable, Apple is pushing the envelope with the single port, and consumers are footing the bill for the new technology with a higher price. While the Air is plenty fast enough for all but the most demanding tasks, I’ve heard more than one user complain that the mobile chip in the MacBook Meh is sluggish. Jony’s styling doesn’t win out over performance with my mom. </p>
<p>In the end, I found a 13” Air with 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, and an Intel i5 for $850 on Apple’s refurbished site. I think Mom will be happy with this machine for many years to come. </p>
<p>Next, my daughter and I are going in on a Mac for her to take to college. That’s an entirely different set of requirements and a different use case, one that I’ll follow up with here, as soon as we decide what to get. </p>
<p>[^1]:   Yes, I’m aware of the dongle. It seems like a wonky workaround.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2017-05-16-My_Next_Mac.html'>My Next Mac</a></h2>
<p>So, yesterday I cleared off my desk and tried to work with nothing but my MacBook again. No standing desk, no external monitor. It looked great, but honestly, it felt terrible. I wound up hunched over the desk staring down at the screen. After an hour or so of this I decided, yet again, that this style of work is just not appropriate for me.</p>
<p>This leads me to a few interesting conclusions when considering what to buy for my next Mac. For one, I find a larger screen much easier to work with. The smaller screen is fine for when I’m loafing on the couch or traveling, but for day-to-day work it just makes <em>getting things done</em> harder. Secondly, the screen needs to be lifted to an ergonomically appropriate height. Photos online of beautiful desks with a single MacBook Adorable, a notebook, and a cup of coffee are nice, but I can’t see how anyone gets any serious work done on the computer in that environment. I always assume that whoever works that way doesn’t spend the majority of their day staring at the screen like I do.</p>
<p>So what's next for me? I’ve been toying with the idea of only using an iPad Pro, and while I think I could work on it just fine, the overall experience would be ergonomically strenuous, and the workflows frustrating. The iPad shows promise, but until I can hook it up to an external keyboard, monitor, and touchpad, it’s not for me, not yet.</p>
<p>I love the look of the MacBook, but I just can’t work with it. I could leave it plugged into my external monitor all day, but there are a host of issues with that too. My monitor, a 24” Dell 4K, looks great, but it doesn’t have a built-in speaker or iSight camera like the old Apple Thunderbolt Display I was used to working with. The resolution is good for staring at text all day, but every time someone I work with wants to do a video conference or something similar I’ve got to either fish out my USB webcam or unplug the laptop. I could leave the laptop open to the side of the display, but I like having a single monitor to concentrate on.</p>
<p>Then there’s the wires. I’ve got a USB hub stashed in my desk drawer, which is plugged into a ScanSnap and a hard drive. The monitor needs power and a plug into the MacBook. The MacBook needs power. There’s too many wires.</p>
<p>Finally, since I have no speakers when the Mac is closed, I have an Amazon Basics bluetooth speaker on the shelf behind my desk. That works fine as long as I have sound being streamed to it. If I go for more then a few minutes without sound, the speaker turns off, which means I have to flip the switch on it to get it to pair again. Not ideal.</p>
<p>So, when considering my options for the next computer, I think there’s really only one choice considering my requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>As few wires as possible</li>
<li>Built-in iSight camera and speakers</li>
<li>Large Retina screen</li>
<li>Ergonomically correct for long periods of work</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds like an iMac to me.</p>

<p>While that <em>might</em> be fine, my personal preference is to keep the core system as close to default as possible.

</article><article><h2><a href='2017-04-04-Beware_of_VPNs.html'>Beware of VPNs</a></h2>
<p>I've seen quite a few smart people recommend using a VPN service in the wake of the U.S. government's decision to repeal privacy rules for ISPs. Unfortunately, I find this advice to be a bit misguided, or at least ill-informed. You can move your risk around, but in the end this comes down to an issue of trust, and avenues of recourse. </p>
<p>A VPN is a Virtual Private Network. It creates an encrypted tunnel between your computer and a remote server, and then <em>optionally</em> routes all of your Internet traffic through that tunnel. The case for using one for security against your ISP is that if your traffic is encrypted, they can't see what you are browsing to and your data becomes useless to them to sell. Once your traffic reaches the other side of the VPN, it's aggregated with all of the service's other customers. That's fine, and mostly makes sense, but if you are going to use a VPN service it's important to come to an honest conclusion about how much you trust the company. </p>
<p>If your VPN server is outside of the United States, you are effectively giving up any legal recourse against the provider, meaning they can do whatever they want with your data, regardless of what they advertise or what they tell their customers. A single gateway for all of your traffic has a tremendous amount of power. They can inject code into any (non-SSL encrypted) web page. They can read all of your email. They can see all of the URLs you visit. All of the power of your ISP, you are transferring to your VPN provider, but if you choose a company outside of the United States, you lose whatever protection or recourse you have now. </p>
<p>What the ISPs are doing is not right, but at least we know what they are doing. If you pick a fly-by-night VPN service and send them all your traffic, there's no telling what they'll do with that data. It doesn't matter if they post good things on their website if you can't verify their claims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple is currently hard at work on a “completely rethought” Mac Pro, with a modular design that can accommodate high-end CPUs and big honking hot-running GPUs, and which should make it easier for Apple to update with new components on a regular basis. They’re also working on Apple-branded pro displays to go with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those of us who make their living on their Mac, this is fantastic news. I might never buy a Mac Pro[^1], but I'll still reap the benefits of Apple's development and focus on Mac hardware and software. This is a message to the community that Apple hasn't lost it's mind; the Mac is still going strong.</p>
<p>What I will plan on buying is a new Apple display. My current Dell 4K display is <em>ok</em>, but after being spoiled by the Thunderbolt Display I had on my desk at the previous gig, this Dell feels like a big step back. No built in iSight camera, no built in speakers, too many wires, and that ugly Dell logo on the front. It's a beautiful screen, and I need that for the number of hours I spend looking at text every day, but it's all the rest of it, that overall Apple experience, that I'm missing.</p>
<p>I'll be interested to hear <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/849235947896098817">what Marco has to say</a> this evening on ATP. He has, at least to my mind, been the biggest skeptic and nay-sayer within the community when it comes to future prospects for the Mac. Of course, that's nothing new. Mac enthusiasts have been hearing that their favorite computer is <em>just</em> about to die for literally decades. Yet here we are.</p>

<p>The book of Philippians is such a beautiful, and challenging book. This is what I needed to hear tonight:</p>

<p><em>Do all things without grumbling or questioning</em>, that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did no run in vain or labor in vain.
Philippians 2:14-16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I admit I've done quite a bit of grumbling and questioning the past few days. On the next page, I saw I had this passage marked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rejoice in the Lord always, again I say rejoice. Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; <em>do not be anxious about anything</em>, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.<em> And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus</em>.
Finally brothers, <strong>whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there his anything worthy of praise, think about these things</strong>.

<p>My daughter's cheerleading coach passed away last night. What was first thought of as diabetes turned out to be an extremely aggressive cancer that took her after only a few months. She was only ten years older than my wife and I. Her family, and our community, will be grieving deeply for her loss.</p>
<p>I know my daughter loved her, and when those we love die they take a part of us with them. Our family has lost parents and grandparents, close friends and people we admire. The pain of their loss can hit any one of us at any time; triggered by a date, or an object, or a memory of how they used to enjoy one thing or another. Sometimes we long for the comforting sound of their voice so much it aches inside us. When they are gone we wish for what everyone wishes for, more time.</p>
<p>But, despite my skepticism, despite my scientific, rational mind that often cries out for reason, I have to believe that there must be something more than this, that when the shadow of reality shimmers away, as it will for all of us, our consciousness, our soul, lives on. While we are bound to our physical bodies in the physical world, we can't see it, but it's there, waiting for each of us. The Bible tells us that each of us is given a certain number of days, and no one knows what that number is. </p>
<p>Our life is so short here, and the human body so fragile. Every second that passes is a second we can never get back. No amount of work or bartering can earn us even a minute more of our life back. But… we can make the passing of our time more worthwhile. </p>
<p>The Bible says that to gain eternal life, you must believe that Jesus is who is says he is and did what he said he did. But after that, what does it say about the time between salvation and eternal life? It says to love God with all your heart, mind, and soul, and to love your neighbor as yourself. It says to love your enemy, and bless those that persecute you. It says that God is love. </p>
<p>If we fill our days with kindness and mercy, if we leave petty ambition and envy behind, if we forgive slights against us, and smile in the face of adversity, if we stand up for what's right, if we are honest and true, if we leave laziness and sloth behind us, if we give ourselves over completely to the task at hand, leaving nothing behind, wouldn't that be a life well lived? </p>
<p>How will you finish the race? How will I? When the end comes for me, will I be able to look back satisfied that I spent my precious seconds the best way I could? Or will I be filled with regrets for the things I did and didn't do? Am I pushing myself to become what I was placed on Earth to be? Or am I stagnating, inventing excuses and becoming bitter about why I can't do one thing or another. </p>
<p>There will always be things you'd like to do, but can't. Hard decisions and tradeoffs for what you believe is best for yourself and your family. Make the decision, embrace it, believe it, and move on to the next right thing to make this one, beautiful, precious life worthwhile. </p>
<p>Learn, build, grow, love. Be kind, gentle, patient, and enduring. Find joy in the moments we have, because life is here for a moment, and then, gone.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2017-02-22-Eero_and_Disney_Circle.html'>Eero and Disney Circle</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>tldr: If you have a Circle device and an Eero mesh network, plug the Circle into the Eero connected to your modem with an ethernet cable. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The router I bought last year just wasn’t cutting it anymore. Several times a day I’d have to turn off wifi and turn it back on again on my Mac, and I’d rarely see speeds over 12 Mbps, even though I’m paying for 100 Mbps from Mediacom. Part of it had to do with the placement of my desk relative to where the router sits, and part of it has to do with running my Mac in clamshell mode through most of the day. Whatever the reason, I was tired of it and splurged for a set of <a href="https://eero.com">three Eero routers</a>. Now I have one in the basement next to the modem, one in the office, and one in the kitchen, and I consistently get speeds around 70-80 Mbps from <a href="fast.com">fast.com</a>. </p>
<p>I was quite happy with my setup, until random devices on my home network suddenly stopped connecting to the Internet. First it was the Apple TV, then the Fire TV, then my daughters laptop, then my other daughters iPhone, then my iPhone, and when it got to my wife’s iPhone something had to change. Of course, I knew the culprit had to be our <a href="https://meetcircle.com/circle/">Circle from Disney</a>. </p>
<p>The Circle is a little white box that sits on the network on controls access. It blocks content that we’d rather not have, and sets time limits, bed times, and reward systems for the kids. We have all the devices assigned to their owners and what we think are reasonable rules setup. For some reason when we hooked up the new routers I thought it’d be a good idea to move the circle out into the office; I guess I wanted to be able to see it. I sat the Circle next to the office Eero and assumed everything would be fine. It was not. </p>
<p>As I understand it, the Eero works by creating a subnetwork underneath your home network that is dedicated to the routers staying in contact with each other. Eero calls the software that manages the the system “<a href="https://eero.com/technology">TrueMesh</a>™”, and it lets a device float between routers in the house without slowing down network speeds. The Circle works by using a technique called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing">ARP poisoning</a>”, where the Circle <a href="https://meetcircle.com/circle/tech-specs/">becomes the default gateway</a> on the network, allowing it to manage the traffic. </p>
<p>So, my theory is that when I set the Circle next to one of the satellite Eero routers, the Circle connected to the closest router and spoofed the default routers ARP address, which caused the router to not be able to communicate with the real default router, breaking the mesh network. Moving the Circle back to the basement and physically connecting[^1] it to the primary router  solved the problem. </p>
<p>I should mention that the Eero also has parental controls similar to Circle’s built in. I haven’t fully explored them yet, but from what I can tell they don’t quite have the feature set of the Circle. Future software updates might change that, I’ll be keeping an eye on it. </p>
<p>Overall I’m quite happy with both the Eero and the Circle. While expensive, the combination of the two gives me a fast, robust home network with detailed controls over who and what connects, what they have access to, and for how long. [^2]</p>
<p>[^1]:   Documentation for the Circle says that if your home internet speed is higher than 60 Mbps you should use the ethernet port. They probably don’t have a radio in the Circle strong enough to support faster speeds.</p>
<p>[^2]:   Also, don’t forget to dust your Eero regularly.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2017-02-05-Nirvana.html'>Nirvana</a></h2>
<p>In Nineteen Ninety-One, I was a freshman in high school, living in a tiny house in small town Montana. Just me and my mom. My family, like so many at the time, had fallen apart. We had moved around a lot, I felt odd and out of place. I was angry, full of teenage angst, and generally pissed off at the world for the hand it dealt me. </p>
<p>Somehow I had talked my mom into letting me have a TV in my room, and I used to stay up late at night to watch MTV broadcast the videos they deemed too weird for the standard days fare. It was one of those nights I saw and heard something new, something fresh and raw,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg">Nirvana’s Smells Like Teen Spirit</a>. It blew me away. Apparently I wasn’t the only one either, because soon after I first saw it the rest of the world discovered Nirvana as well. </p>
<p>It’s hard to overstate the impact Nirvana had. They really were something different, at least to me. A melding of punk and pure rock-n-roll, three guys in a garage belting their rage into the abyss. To me, the kid that I was, Nirvana was the complete opposite of the popular butt-rock of the time. I mean seriously, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_What_the_Cat_Dragged_In#/media/File:Poison-Look-What-the-Cat-Dragged-In.jpg">look at these guys</a>. </p>
<p>I remember offroading in the backwoods of Montana, my friend driving way too fast in his S10 pickup, playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkcJEvMcnEg">Lithium</a> as loud as it would go, and the both of us howling with delight as we launched the pickup over another hill. </p>
<p>Nirvana led me to Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Screaming Trees, Smashing Pumpkins, Blind Melon and so many more. They opened up the world of music to me by channeling what they felt through what they created, and I <em>got it</em>, because I felt that way too. Of course the lyrics of Smells Like Teen Spirit didn’t make any sense, but they didn’t have to, the world we were awakening to didn’t make any sense either. All we could to do was rage, rage, rage. </p>
<p>But not all the time. There were times of reflective introspection, easy, hopeful times of mindless joy, quiet times with the best of friends. A few years later, after the candle had burned so brightly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain#Death">light was put out</a>.</p>
<p>Nirvana spoke to me in a way that nothing else did at the time. Nowadays I never listen to grunge, I mostly prefer jazz and classical. I also can’t say that the bands message is something I believe in now. I’ve moved on. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2017-01-14-On_Computing_Tomorrow.html'>On Computing Tomorrow</a></h2>
<p>I’ve been thinking more about my defense of the Mac as a long-term computing platform, and I’m slowly coming around to understanding that at the base of my ideas is a type of willful ignorance that I should know better than to indulge in. The world is changing, computers are changing, and how we work and interact with them is changing drastically. To get to the root of this, let’s follow the five “whys” of why I need a Mac to work. </p>
<p>I need a Mac to get my work done. <em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Because the Mac is a Unix based computer that includes the standard set of tools I use day to day, and it’s solid and reliable enough for me to depend on to work well when I need it.</p>
<p><em>Why do I need a Unix computer to work?</em></p>
<p>Because I’m a devops engineer, or automation engineer, or advanced sysadmin, whatever you’d care to call this job at the moment. I work primarily with AWS, and the best tools for building the automation systems for deploying our applications use the command line. Not to mention I often need to ssh into a server to troubleshoot it. </p>
<p><em>Why does the AWS environment use the command line?</em></p>
<p>Well, technically the command line is just one of the tools available, the awscli tools talk back to the AWS API, and AWS has SDKs available for popular languages. I could, and often do, write python code to accomplish what I need done. I suppose the real answer to this question is that there is currently no better interface for doing what I do.</p>
<p><em>Why is there no better interface for doing what you need to do?</em></p>
<p>Because designing human interfaces that make sense is difficult, especially with complex concepts. We need to be able to express logically that one bit of code needs to pull data from another bit of code which is pulling data from a database, all the while ensuring that the customer is getting the information they need quickly and easily. </p>
<p><em>Why are the systems you work with so complicated?</em></p>
<p>That’s a good question. Maybe they don’t need to be, or maybe in the near future they won’t be anymore. My work involves manipulating data, building websites that allow people access to upload and download data, and ensuring that the infrastructure these systems run on remains fast and available. How much of this is now being built into platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform? How much of what I do each day could soon be accomplished by machine learning?</p>
<p>What if you could ask your phone to generate a graph of Apple’s annual profit and loss, and be sure that the visuals it returned were accurate and reliable? What if I could tell an iPad to build a highly available, auto-scaling infrastructure for hosting the Python code in my git repository, and the iPad would just go out and build everything I needed? How far are we from AI being able to tell from looking at a git repo the details of the infrastructure it needs? In that scenario, what use is “devops” when the engineer is AWS? For that matter, how far away are we from telling the computer the logic of what we need and having it develop the code for us?</p>
<p>Possibly not far. A <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/05/the-end-of-code/">recent article in Wired</a>explores this very possibility:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional coding won’t disappear completely—indeed, O’Reilly predicts that we’ll still need coders for a long time yet—but there will likely be less of it, and it will become a meta skill, a way of creating what Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, calls the “scaffolding” within which machine learning can operate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That scaffolding is where I’ve been aiming my career for quite a while now, but, it may not be enough. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the long run, Thrun says, machine learning will have a democratizing influence. In the same way that you don’t need to know HTML to build a website these days, you eventually won’t need a PhD to tap into the insane power of deep learning. Programming won’t be the sole domain of trained coders who have learned a series of arcane languages. It’ll be accessible to anyone who has ever taught a dog to roll over. “For me, it’s the coolest thing ever in programming,” Thrun says, “because now anyone can program.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basic economics says that scarcity creates value, in a world where anyone can program the skill currently required would be drastically devalued. This predicts a move from “infrastructure as code” to “infrastructure as algorithmically determined”. </p>
<p>I need a Mac for what I do now, but if current trends continue I might not need a Mac for much longer to do my job. In fact, as the tech industry continues to evolve, it’s entirely possible that it will evolve to the point where it no longer needs me. When that happens, maybe I’ll finally open up that coffee shop I’ve been dreaming about for decades. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/app-extensions-are-not-a-replacement-for-user-automation/">Link</a></p>
<p>Sal Soghoian, writing for MacStories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s a thought experiment. Let’s imagine that Apple decided to combine their engineering resources to form app teams that delivered both iOS and macOS versions of applications. </p>
<p>In such a scenario it may seem logical to retain application features common to both platforms and to remove those that were perceived to require extra resources. Certainly Automation would be something examined in that regard, and the idea might be posited that: “App Extensions are equivalent to, or could be a replacement for, User Automation in macOS.” And by User Automation, I’m referring to Apple Event scripting, Automator, Services, the UNIX command line utilities, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve said many times that one of the main reasons I came to OS X is the underlying Unix utilities. I literally <em>can’t do my job</em> without the command line. It’s always in my dock, it’s always open, and I’ve got it customized just the way I like it. There is no replacement for the terminal, and no App Extension can provide a way for me to string together the tools I use to get done what needs to get done. </p>
<p>In such a world like Sal is imagining, I would have to find an SSH app like Prompt and setup my entire development environment on a Linux server somewhere. While possible, it’s not economical and it’s certainly not how I’ve become accustomed to working. I don’t think I’m alone in this either, anyone who does web development relies on command line versions of Python, Ruby, PHP, or Perl, along with a host of other small utilities to do things like syntax checking or unit tests. </p>
<p>I think it’s possible that Apple could remove the Terminal from OS X, along with the Unix utilities, similar to what they’ve done with iOS, but I don’t think they will. Apple uses OS X to develop their own software, so they know what the developers need to be efficient and productive. However I could see a world where you had to install Xcode and enable “developer mode” to get to the Unix utilities. We may not be far away from a day when OS X no longer ships with Terminal.app, but I think we’ll always have a way to install it when there’s real work that needs done. </p>
<p>I think Apple may be heading in the wrong direction, and it’s sad to see Sal be let go, but I’m glad to see him carrying on fighting for the users. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2017-01-03-Future_Viability_of_the_Mac.html'>Future Viability of the Mac</a></h2>
<p>Despite aspirations of expanding my fields of interest and adopting new hobbies outside of technology, my day-to-day work gets done on a Mac. I’ve got a vested interest in the Macs continued survival, I’m one of those “truck drivers” that uses their machine for all it’s worth, and would have a difficult time transitioning to anything else. In my job I need to run shell scripts and build Docker containers, I need to ssh to Linux servers and RDP into Windows instances. I need to write, edit, and run Python code that connects to a database through a ssh tunnel. I need to do things that are either difficult or simply impossible with iOS, but are dead simple[^1] with a Mac. </p>
<p>That’s why I switched to a Mac in the first place, someone had finally put a useable interface on top of a solid Unix core. The Mac community, especially the third-party developers, is why I stay on the Mac. I <em>could</em> get my work <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop">done on Linux</a>, but my Lord, <em>why would I want to</em>? My degree is in human-computer interaction, I’d spend half my time ranting about the thousands of paper cuts in the user interface until I abandoned the GUI and ran everything from the command line, or a stripped down paneling interface. I’ve <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/the-coffee-cup">been there before</a>. The Mac is a comfortable work environment that doesn’t skimp on capability like iOS does. Look deep enough into any of the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/one-year-of-ipad-pro/">iOS only workflows</a> and nearly all of them are relying on outside computing devices of some type to get around what iOS can’t do. </p>
<p>But today we are once again hearing the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-20/how-apple-alienated-mac-loyalists?cmpid=yhoo.headline&amp;yptr=yahoo">death knell being rung for the Mac</a>. This time it’s not because of an outside source taking over, but Apple itself who might simply decide that the Mac isn’t worth keeping around anymore. This is despite it being a profitable business, and being the sole source of development for iOS apps, and despite it being an industry leader in features and design, the tech media have decided that Apple is only a breath away from blowing out the Mac candle forever. </p>
<p>Well, we’ve been here before, right? It was before my time as an Apple user, but it’s my understanding that in the late ‘90s you <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-nor1.htm">couldn’t swing a dead cat</a> without hitting on an industry “think piece” about the <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/death_knell">death of the Mac</a>. Yet, here we are at the dawn of 2017 and the Mac is still here. </p>
<p>That’s not to say that it isn’t entirely possible that Apple might kill off the Mac <em>Pro</em>, or the Mac <em>Mini</em>. I wouldn’t be too surprised if neither of those products existed by the end of the year. But a new macOS-running computer of some sort is something I expect to be able to buy for the next three years, at least.[^2] </p>
<p>Assuming the current Mac I’m typing this on lasts for the next three years, which it should unless I break it somehow, my next Mac should last for another estimated three to five years. Let’s just say I draw this out as far as I can and say five, that means I’ve got <em>at least eight years</em> of Mac use easily planned for the future.  Which of us can look that far into the future and see what the computing industry or our lives will look like by then? Perhaps the iPad and iOS will finally have matured enough to make Macs truly obsolete, or perhaps my work requirements will have changed sufficiently to make adopting iOS full-time relatively painless. Who knows? </p>
<p>The point is, all this handwringing over the future of the Mac is overblown. We have years of macOS ahead of us. Apple is selling some fantastic Macs right now[^3], and I expect they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Until iOS actually is better than the Mac, there’s no reason to think that any of us will have to adopt our toolset to another platform. The Mac is here, has been here, and from what I can see, will continue to be here for many years to come. </p>
<p>[^1]:   Well, dead simple in the sense of “if you have nearly two decades of Unix experience under your belt”. </p>
<p>[^2]:   If not for the rest of my working life.</p>
<p>[^3]:   And some very poor ones, I’ll give you that. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2016-12-31-iCloud_Failed_When_I_Needed_it_Most.html'>What Worked, and What Didn’t in 2016</a></h2>
<p>Part of what’s been great about using Apple products is the feeling of living just a little bit in the future. The Mac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad paved a way towards a far less complicated future, where technology was seamlessly integrated into our lives, and enhanced our day to day interactions with our work and with each other. Apple, better than anyone, understands that technology is at it’s best when it’s nearly invisible. But, living in the future comes at a price, namely a sacrifice of stability and accepted norms of <em>what works</em>. </p>
<p>Yesterday we were driving to see family who lives three hours away. About a half hour into the trip I got a Skype message from a friend asking for some technical help. After he explained the problem I knew how to fix his issue, but I needed to SSH into a server to do it. Unfortunately, I left my Mac at home, and had nothing but my iPhone. Undaunted[^1], I setup a VPN and downloaded <a href="https://www.panic.com/prompt/">Prompt by Panic</a>. This is where I ran into a problem. To SSH into the server I needed to get my private key[^2]. Prompt would use the key if I could get it copied into my clipboard, but getting it there turned out to be more of a hurdle than I could overcome. </p>
<p>I tried to get the key from <a href="https://www.backblaze.com">BackBlaze</a>, but the iOS client wouldn’t let me view the text of the key or to export it with a share sheet, it only told me the type of file it was, which was no help. I also thought that I <em>might</em> have a copy of the key[^3] in a zip file in my Archive folder under my Documents folder, and I recently turned on iCloud sync for my entire <a href="https://www.apple.com/icloud/icloud-drive/">Desktop and Documents</a> folders, so I thought I should have been able to get to the key from there. In what was probably the most frustrating technical failure of the night, the iCloud app refused to download any file, and any other app I had installed that also had access to iCloud also refused to download files or would simply freeze up and crash. </p>
<p>The point of moving documents into the cloud was to have them when I needed them, but when I did need them the system failed. To add insult to injury, when I wanted to look up something frivolous this morning the app worked fine. I’ve since turned that feature off. If I can’t rely on it, it’s not worth it having it turned on. I <em>wanted</em> to live in the future where I never had to think about having access to my data, where it’s just always there when I need it, but in this case, the future simply isn’t ready quite yet. </p>
<p>This fiasco caused me to think a bit more about what has and has not worked in technology in 2016. A lot of virtual ink has been spilled about virtual reality and self-driving cars, but neither of them are quite ready for the real world yet, not that I’ve seen anyway. Social media has allowed <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/10/18/disney-twitter-image">trolls to run rampant</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/jobs/quit-social-media-your-career-may-depend-on-it.html?smtyp=cur">sucked our attention reserves dry</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/17/facebook-fake-news-writer-i-think-donald-trump-is-in-the-white-house-because-of-me/">helped elect</a> the single most unqualified president in history to the highest office in the land. Twitter and Facebook have had great years in the past, but 2016 was not one of them. I’ve withdrawn almost completely from both of them, but I’m looking forward to Manton finally unveiling <a href="http://micro.blog/about">micro.blog</a>. Yahoo announced that they let over a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/yahoo-hack.html?_r=0">billion accounts get hacked</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_National_Committee_email_leak">DNC got hacked</a>, and the <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/10/22/498954197/internet-outage-update-internet-of-things-hacking-attack-led-to-outage-of-popula">Internet of Things</a> got hacked. Overall, not a good year for online security either. A great year to be a <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a> customer though.  </p>
<p>2016 was a not-too-subtle reminder to be critical of the organizations and devices which play a role in our lives. A reminder that trust is easily lost and not easily regained. That the promises people make are not always the ones they keep. </p>
<p>So, what <em>has</em> worked? On a personal level, while I’ve been critical of my need for the application in the past, my experience with <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/products.html">DEVONthink and DEVONthink to Go</a> has always been exactly what the developers said it would be. I’ve never lost data, the new sync works reliably and securely, and the company continues to be active and responsive with their customers. I’ve left DEVONthink in the past, 2017 is the year I commit to it wholeheartedly. </p>
<p>My Mac, iPhone, and Apple TV continue to work well. I almost never have an issue with any device. The one issue I had with my iPhone was recognized by Apple as being widespread and they fixed it for me at no cost. My particular <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/The_Recipe">recipe for apps</a> on my Mac continues to work well, although I removed Byword shortly after writing it to consolidate all writing in Ulysses. Speaking of which, Ulysses deserves a special mention as being rock solid, beautiful, and reliable. It’s my favorite writing application, probably ever. Likewise, Day One continues to be fantastic, and receives my highest recommendation for consistent, intentional journalling. There’s more that’s worked over the past year, things silently working along in the background, but these are the things that stand out to me.</p>
<p>I work in the technology industry. I’ve spent sixteen years (so far) studying where and how it fails, what works, what doesn’t, and how to get the most out of our investment. This year my optimism took a hit, and more things than I expected failed. In 2017, I’m looking forward to finding new ways for this tech to not only become more invisible, but more trustworthy as well. 2017 is not just about personal benefit, it’s about security and social conscience as well. It’s about choosing technology that works best for yourself, and for everyone involved. I’m looking forward to exploring exactly what that means as we sail into the uncharted waters of a new year. </p>

<p>Why would I want to do this? The idea of opening up any Mac and being able to get right to work without any setup is appealing, but honestly, how often do I move to a new Mac? Not very. And the apps that I do use are pretty easy to set up. </p>
<p>Some apps, like MindNode or OmniGraffle are almost impossible to replicate. And others, like Day One, offer so much more than built in apps that I wouldn’t want to move away from them. It’s possible that any third-party app might go out of business <a href="https://plausible.coop/voodoopad/">or be abandoned</a>, but if I’m careful about what I choose I think I can be reasonably safe in trusting them. </p>
<p>Both the 3rd party apps and the built in apps are playing in a fairly level playing field. They use the same APIs (although the Apple apps get to use some private APIs), the same underpinnings, the same frameworks. The 3rd party apps are, for the most part, simply better done. Like Bear vs Notes for example. Bear is absolutely the better application. Beautiful, well thought out, and has useful features that Notes misses. And, Notes insists on using that ridiculous faux-paper background, and makes it difficult to change the font or font-size of the text. Bear is better, but Notes is built in. But Bear is just a quick trip to the App Store away, but sync costs $15 per year. But at least it’s a good business model that should keep them around. If not, Bear exports my notes easily, so I think it’s safe. </p>
<p>I think the unique mix of applications that are installed on each persons Mac or iOS device is interesting. It's like a recipe for a good soup, some ingredients have more flavor than others. Some are fresh, some may have <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/Yojimbo/">grown a bit stale</a>. Some you can grow yourself. Everyone has their own recipe that works best for them, and by sharing we can learn from each other. Using only the built-in apps is like buying pre-made soup off the shelf from WalMart. You can live off it, but the good stuff <a href="http://thesweetsetup.com">is found elsewhere</a>.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the meager resources NASA had when they sent a man to the moon for the first time. We can accomplish amazing things when we put our collective minds to it. And what are Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft doing with their collective billions and billions of dollars in research and development? Building ever more immersive ways for us to share funny cat videos. </p>
<p>It bothers me in a way that so much money is spent on such frivolous things when there are real challenges in the world that our smartest people could be putting their minds to. Could a portion of those billions of dollars be spent figuring out how to get clean water to every person in the world? Or how to overcome drought by filtering seawater? </p>
<p>There are pursuits that are worthwhile and pursuits that are noble, and they are so often not the same thing. Every now and then though, they are. I think what <a href="https://www.tesla.com/energy">Tesla</a> is doing is both worthwhile from a financial perspective and noble in that by creating technology that relies on clean power they are benefiting everyone. It's possible that a good sum of Apple's ten billion is also going towards electric, self-driving cars, but we haven't seen the fruit of that research yet.

</article><article><h2><a href='2016-10-20-Dance.html'>The Dancer</a></h2>
<p>We humans are complicated creatures. I run for miles at a time, even though I’ve got nowhere to go, and nothing is chasing me, nothing but time and old age. Some people collect stamps, others watch birds; there’s no end to the ways that we occupy our time. Some people write stories, or draw, or paint, or make pottery out of clay. Some people write poetry. My daughter, my oldest, spends her time practicing the ancient art of <em>dance</em>. </p>
<p>Over the years that I’ve been taking her to dance practice and recitals, I’ve spent quite a bit of time pondering the significance of dance. Why do we do it? What sort of purpose does it serve? I’m reminded of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS1esgRV4Rc">Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society</a> on why we read and write poetry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poetry, beauty, romance, love… and dance. </p>
<p>Dance, a physical expression of emotion, the rhythmic movement of the human body. <em>The endless, impossible pursuit of perfection</em>. </p>
<p>To dance takes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY0cdXr_1MA">dedication and courage</a>. It takes practicing before the sun comes up and finishing after everyone else has long gone to bed. It takes a willingness to incur injury in pursuit of your art. It takes being able to forget all that and have fun. To lose yourself in the moment, to revel in your ability, gliding from one motion to the next, emotions coming to form like firecrackers on the stage. Body and mind working together in unity. </p>
<p>As I’ve watched my daughter grow up over the years and explore her chosen pastime, I’ve thought deeply on the purpose of dance, and how easy it is for those of us with highly analytical and logical minds to discard or ignore the pure joy of artistic expression. I’ve seen reference to a debate over whether dance is an art or a sport. The question is wrongheaded, dance is both, of course.  My daughter has grown to show poise and grace while on the lighted stage, performing before crowds that would freeze lesser individuals with stage fright. After every single performance I’ve seen I come away feeling more proud of her than ever. </p>
<p>This is her senior year of high school, which, one, means I’m officially old now, and two, in a few months she’s going to set out on her own big adventure. I know that with the dedication, courage, and ability she’s developed over the years she is going to be fantastic. While it will be bittersweet to see her leave home, I can’t wait to watch her start to fly. There will be hard times to come, as in anyone’s life, but through it all I hope she never stops dancing. </p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2016-09-29-Homecoming_Night.html'>Homecoming Night</a></h2>
<p>One of the surest ways I know I’m well on my way to crotchety old man status is not the grey in my hair, but my gut reaction to a certain tradition in our small town. To celebrate homecoming, our high school cheerleaders and dance team spends the night covering the high school football players houses, cars, and possibly yards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_papering">with toilet paper</a>, saran wrap, and plastic forks. They call it tradition, I call it vandalism, but, like so many other things in this tiny Iowa town, I’m simply outvoted. </p>
<p>One of the oddest aspects of this annual event is that it’s completely legitimized by the adults in town. Some of them even drive the kids around to the different houses. I know TP’ing happened when I was a kid too, but at the time it was done by kids who snuck out at night and did it knowing full well it was illegal and that if caught, they would be in somewhat serious trouble. Last year, one of the local cops helped the cheerleaders throw a roll of toilet paper at a house. It’s like the kids who used to do this on their own grew up and wanted to make sure their kids had the same experience, but in a safe, supervised way. </p>
<p>So tonight teams of cheerleaders and dancers will drive around the area, chauffeured by a few parents,  and visit 28 homes. At each of the homes various acts of light-hearted vandalism will occur, throwing toilet paper over the house and trees, wrapping the cars in saran wrap, and maybe even filling up the front yard with plastic forks, known, I’m told, as forking the yard. The kids and parents involved say it’s all in good fun, and I understand that, what I don’t understand is who cleans up the mess after the night is over. TP makes a heck of a mess when it gets wet, and if it rains in the next few days some folks are going to have a heck of a time getting it off their homes and property. </p>
<p>Speaking of it raining, another prank that I’ve been told is reserved for those that <em>really deserve it</em> is to fill the front yard with a few boxes of instant mashed potatoes. After it rains, as I understand it, I’ve never seen this done, the potatoes absorb the water and cover the yard. I imagine the owner would have to shovel it out. </p>
<p>The kids have a great time and get to feel like they are breaking the rules, even though the rules have been temporarily adjusted, so they aren’t actually rebelling at all. I think that’s really where the crux of my issue with this tradition lays. It’s become phony, fake. Like mandatory corporate shuffleboard or trust falls. The kids aren’t really being rebellious; this is all pre-planned, packaged and vacuum wrapped like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunchables">lunchable</a>. Sometimes I wonder if we are doing the next generation any favors by protecting them so much. There can be no bravery without danger. </p>
<p>But, it <em>is</em> all in good fun. No one gets hurt, no one is in trouble. No one complains about cleaning up the mess, at least no one I’ve talked to has. Maybe some of the kids from the teams have to clean it up, I don’t know. I’m just the grouchy old man who <em>really</em> wants the kids to stay off my lawn. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2016-09-25-Thinking_it_Through.html'>Thinking it Through</a></h2>
<p>My favorite new-to-me site is <a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com">Farnam Street</a> by Shane Parrish. I’ve been experiencing a slow change of interests over the past several months as Apple and tech related news fails to grab my attention. The last time this happened I lost more than a professional interest in the open source community, an area I left years ago and haven’t looked back. I can’t find it in me to care enough about iOS 10 to read the book-length treaties on it at MacStories, in fact the latest iPhone or iOS barely interests me enough to learn what’s in it and if it is anything of use to me. </p>
<p>I just don’t care anymore. My tools of choice work well, and I’m comfortable knowing that there’s nothing better. Instead, I’m turning my attention to a topic that I’ve been dancing around for the past few years, but haven’t put a concerted effort into, something <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Cal Newport calls <em>Deep Work</em></a>. I’ve always been fascinated with how the mind works, and exploring the outer boundaries of the human brain. The psychology courses I took in grad school were among my favorites, and how we think about the world around us is endlessly fascinating. </p>
<p>Farnam Street is chock-full of insight into the human condition, where we fail, and how we can be better. Being a little better every day is exactly what I want to pursue, To that end, I’m in the middle of an experiment right now, once it’s over I’ll report my findings, but my thought is that after 30 days I’ll be more focused, happier, and more productive than when I started. <em>Better</em>. </p>
<p>I’m giving up a few things, and putting my energy into other things, but let’s leave that alone for now and return to this idea of <em>areas of focus</em>. I once considered myself a part of the Apple community. I was a developer for a short time, and a writer for a popular blog. I followed all the right people on Twitter, subscribed to all the right podcasts, and generally knew what was going on in the community of internet famous folks in the Apple community. I still do, to a point, but as I’ve stated earlier, I just don’t care about it anymore. One of the things I’ve given up is the thought that I’m going to be any more of a part of this community than someone on the outside looking in. I don’t have time for such juvenile pastimes, and this hobby was not actually making my life better. </p>
<p>I’ll dip my toes in from time to time to see what’s going on and see if any new developments are coming down that pipes that might make my tools better, but I’m not diving in and swimming in it anymore. Perhaps one day some online technical community will interest me again. Instead I’m taking a more realistic approach to my time, and turning my attention to those things that actually do make me a better person. My plan is to write about those things here.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2016-09-10-Studying_in_the_Pit.html'>Studying in the Pit</a></h2>
<p>I just started reading <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Cal Newport’s <em>Deep Work</em></a> and I’ve found myself nodding along in agreement through the introduction and first two chapters. His description of the environment needed for intense, concentrated study reminded me of a time I went through a period of deep work, one that is unfortunately difficult to replicate. </p>
<p>Eighteen years ago I was on my second six-month deployment to the Mediterranean on the USS Platte, an <em>auxiliary oiler</em>. It took us two weeks to cross the Atlantic back then, and once in the Med we would spend anywhere from one to three weeks underway between port visits. Everyone in the Navy has a job, and for the first three years I was in the Navy my job was Machinery Repairman, abbreviated “MR”.  Along with your job designation, everyone in the Navy has a rate, and my rate at the time was E3, also called “Fireman”, so my title at the time was MRFN Buys.[^1]</p>
<p>I desperately wanted to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petty_officer_third_class">Petty Officer Third Class</a> (E4), the next promotion level. The first three promotions (E1 through E3) are given as soon as you serve the requisite amount of time. The subsequent promotions require testing and a complex scoring system that ranks your performance through reviews. The Navy will have only a certain number of slots open for E4 in each rate (job), so sometimes even if you ace the test, you won’t be promoted because of the “needs of the Navy”. Machinery Repairman was one of those jobs that was saturated at the time. I had taken the semiannual test twice, and twice had not made petty officer third class. </p>
<p>I <em>really</em> wanted to make third. Higher rate meant better pay, and I was newly married with a baby on the way. Working in engineering meant that I spent a lot of my time working in the fire room, where the boilers and other high-pressure steam system equipment lived. It was always hot, I mean <em>really</em> hot, and there was no natural light. We worked in blue overalls with the sleeves rolled up, we took readings on the equipment on a regular schedule, smoked and hoped nothing would break. Sometimes, depending on what else was going on around the ship, we might have to split our shifts on watch down to six and six; six hours on watch, six hours off, and one of those six hours off we had to spend doing our main jobs. So for up to eighteen hours a day I was hot, sweaty, and covered in grease. To be honest, most of the time the rotation wasn’t quite that bad, but from time to time it would be. </p>
<p>When I’d wash my hands and face and head up to the mess decks for lunch or dinner, I’d meet up with some of the guys who had been on the ship for as long as I had who had made rate already and worked in Radio. They’d come down in  their crisp, clean dungarees, shiny boondockers with a mirror polish, and complain about how cold it was in Radio. During one of these lunches I decided to <em>cross-rate</em>. The Navy has a system where you can apply to take the E4 test of a different rate. I made up my mind to cross-rate to Radioman, then, I reasoned, I could make rate and get out of the pit. </p>
<p>Cross-rating isn’t easy though. I had to learn an entirely new field of work, and I had to keep up with my existing responsibilities. I filled out all the requisite paperwork, got approval, and started to study. I got ahold of the <a href="http://navy-radio.com/manuals/rm32.htm">Radioman 3 &amp; 2</a>  and a thick spiral-ringed notebook and started carrying them with me on watch in the pit. Between times when I had to take readings on the equipment, I focused all of my energy into learning everything I could about the rate, devouring the book while learning about  wave propagation and transmitter and receiver theory. I talked some of the senior petty officers into letting me spend some of the time between watches or after my regular job was over up in Radio getting hands-on experience. I had two sets of uniforms in my rack, one for the pit, and one for Radio. I kept this up for weeks. </p>
<p>By the time the test came around, I not only scored high enough to make RM3 (Radioman, Petty Officer Third Class), I blew the test out of the water. The period of intense, focused effort resulted in a major change in my life. After I made RM3 the Navy combined the RM and DP (data processing) rates, creating the new Information Technician rate, who dealt with all of the ship and shore based communications and computer systems. Becoming a Radioman changed my career path from a machinist to what has evolved into devops. It was hard, but my life is immeasurably better because of the work I put in. </p>
<p>After making E4, I turned my attention to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_warfare_insignia#Enlisted_surface_warfare_specialist">Enlisted Surface Warfare Specialist</a>. I spent the rest of the deployment learning about every facet of the ships operation, from the bridge to the engine room, from the main steam cycle to semaphores. I absolutely loved it. My last few months on the ship were the best. Learning how to apply myself diligently to achieve goals is a skill I wish I would have learned earlier in life, but once I did learn it I’ve been able to call on it when I need to. It can be difficult to isolate myself from distractions and focus as a remote knowledge worker in 2016, but I’ve never forgot the lessons of the pit. Hard work, sweat, and diligent, concentrated effort are the keys to success. </p>
<p>[^1]:   I actually was on several fire teams, but this designation as “Fireman” is not the same a a civilian firefighter. It simply means I was at the third lowest pay grade in the engineering. </p>

It’s an unfair, harsh, and unforgiving world out there, and if you weren’t born with a silver spoon in your mouth it’s unlikely you’ll ever know life without struggle. </p>
<p>Unlikely, but not impossible. That’s what I keep telling myself anyway.</p>

Making <a href="https://thefocuscourse.com/behind-the-scenes-six-figure-course-launch/">enough money in a week</a> to last for a year. Again, he’s smart, he’s found his niche, and he’s worked hard. It’s just not the natural human emotion to feel good about others succeeding where you have not. It takes effort.</p>
<p>Manton Reece talked about this a bit in his post “<a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/10/a-great-developer-can-come-from-anywhere.html">A great developer can come from anywhere</a>”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daniel Jalkut and I had Marco as a special guest on <a href="http://coreint.org/200">Core Intuition 200</a> not just because he’s a friend but also because he so well represents the goal that many of us have and our listeners have — to start our own company, to find success not just one time but again and again, and to have as thoughtful an approach as possible in the craft of software development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m tempted to quote the entire article. Manton makes the case that while some people dismiss Marco’s approach to testing as a privilege he enjoys as a byproduct of his success, this concept is poison to the community. Saying “that’s fine for Marco, but it wouldn’t work for the average guy” is giving yourself an excuse not to work as hard or push as hard as needed to make it. It’s important to remember that Marco’s success came after years of mostly anonymous work. And of course, success breeds success, he’s been able to build off of one to make a success of the next. </p>
<p>Manton ends his post by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll never accept the implied negativity in the “that’s fine for Marco” argument. I’ll never accept that we should be jealous of another developer’s success instead of inspired by it to do our best work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first reaction to the Overcast announcement was to post a quick tweet about not wanting to help finance Marco’s next Tesla, but that would have come from a place of jealousy and bitterness, not inspiration. Instead, I’m going to go back to my notebook, my collection of ideas, and look over it again. </p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2016-09-08-Post-Apple_Event_Notes.html'>The September Apple Event</a></h2>
<p>Another keynote came and went yesterday, and there was nothing I could do after it was over. I couldn’t order the new iPhone 7, or upgrade my current iPhone to iOS 10. I couldn’t buy the new Apple Watch, and even the new iWork collaborative editing features are in new versions “<a href="http://www.apple.com/numbers/">coming soon</a>”. When I tried to download the new Mario game, the App Store let me know I’d be notified when it was available. After everything was announced yesterday, today I’m wondering what the point of having the event when they did was. </p>
<p>There was once a time when you could download new apps or operating systems as soon as the keynote was over. I specifically remember Steve saying more than once “… and it’s available <em>today</em>”. For the past few years we haven’t been getting that. At best the new features are coming in a couple of weeks, or at worst at some undefined time, presumably so far in the future that they can’t nail down a specific date. </p>
<p>It’s good to ship products when they are ready and not at an arbitrary keynote date, but Apple used to be better at coordinating those times to all coincide. By not having anything available on day one, Apple misses out on the consumer excitement it generates by having these events in the first place. At least, I’m not as excited today as I was yesterday. After they keynote was over if I had the ability to order a new Series Two Apple Watch, I almost certainly would have. After giving it a day to think it over, now I’m not as convinced that I need one. I’ll probably wait for the first few reviews to come in and see how much of an upgrade it is.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is another sign of Apple’s confidence and maturity as a massive global corporation. It’s possible that the internal workings of scheduling all the moving parts is impossible to line up correctly. It used to be we only had the one platform and one operating system, the Mac and OS X.[^1] Now we have the Mac, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and Apple TV; macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS, as well as iCloud to tie everything together, and the multiple services  Apple provides. Now add the complexities of global shipping and coordinating their retail stores around the world, and I can start to make out why it might not all line up the same as it used to. </p>
<p>However, it doesn’t change the fact that the event came and went, and after it was over there was nothing I could do but read about what’s coming. </p>
<p><strong>iPhone 7</strong></p>
<p>I upgrade every two years on the “S” cycle, so on the off years, like this one, I get a glimpse of what’s coming when I do decide to upgrade. Overall the new iPhone seems like a great upgrade. I think they’ve taken appropriate steps to mitigate the uproar over removing the headphone jack by both including an adapter and setting a reasonable price for replacements. I’ve got at least another year with my current iPhone 6S, so by the time I’m ready to upgrade the story won’t be a story anymore. </p>
<p>More concerning is removing the physical home button and replacing it with a 3D Touch area. This is one of those things that I really hope works well, but since I haven’t been impressed with 3D Touch on the 6S, I’m skeptical of how well it’ll work for the most-used button on the phone. How fast will it respond to double-clicking for the app switcher? The exiting 3D Touch app switcher, where you press on the side of the phone is terrible, I never know if I’m about to damage my phone or what amount of pressure to apply. I find it unreliable enough that I don’t use it. Again, hopefully by the 7S model this will be resolved. Better camera, better color, faster CPU, all good things. </p>
<p><strong>AirPods</strong></p>
<p>I already lost them in the couch. Then another pair went through the wash. I’ll probably not be getting these. </p>
<p><strong>Apple Watch Series 2</strong></p>
<p>I wear a fitbit most days, but I run with my phone strapped to my arm, tracking my runs with the Nike+ Run Club app. When the Apple Watch was first announced being able to run without my phone was the first thing that came to mind, but the hardware wasn’t ready yet. The Watch didn’t have the ability to accurately track distance without GPS, so it still needed to be paired with the phone, which defeated the purpose for what I wanted it for. Now that GPS has finally been added I’m seriously thinking about getting one to replace my fitbit as a personal fitness coach and tracker, but I’m going to want to hear how it works for a few other people first. </p>
<p>That the watch is waterproof now is nice, but not a big deal for me. Sometimes I run in the rain, and not having to worry about my phone getting wet would be nice, but I haven’t swam for a few years. I suppose if I ever start training for a triathlon it’ll come in handy. </p>
<p>I use Nike’s apps, and have for about 1640 miles, but that Nike-branded Apple Watch was just plain ugly. No way I’m putting down any money for that band. The pure white Nike band looks acceptable, but still not as nice as the black sport band. </p>
<p><strong>Assorted Nuts</strong></p>
<p>The enhancements to iWork would have been more interesting to me a few years ago when I was in grad school. I had to write a few collaborative papers, and the only way to do it at the time was Google Docs, but I would have much rather worked in Pages. Of course, I still probably would have had to use Google Docs because the other students I worked with weren’t on Macs. </p>
<p>The Mario game looks like fun, I’ll buy it when it comes out, but what I’m really looking forward to is a proper Zelda adventure. We’ll see how far Nintendo’s commitment to iOS goes. </p>
<p>I could have done without Tim Cook singing, but the skit was fine. Better than previous attempts have been. </p>
<p>I quipped on Twitter that Phil Schiller reminded me of the Cowardly Lion from the Wizard of Oz when he started talking about <em>courage</em>. It does take some amount of courage to “push the human race forward”, and if Apple has to do it one port at a time, then I’m on board for the ride. I just think they could have found a better way to come across, a better way to convey their reasoning and the purpose behind the change. I’m not going to miss the port, as long as I’ve got headphones I’m fine, but I use either a bluetooth speaker or the built in speakers more often than the headphones, especially now that I’m not driving to work every day and listening to podcasts in the car. </p>
<p>Yesterday’s announcements were about what was expected, Mario being the notable exception. There was not a lot for me, personally, to get excited about. I’m in the market for a new Mac, so I’m hoping for a refresh next month. Then maybe I’ll get excited. </p>
<p>[^1]:   Well, I suppose you could count the iPod as a platform, but it was so much simpler that it doesn’t really compare.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2016-08-04-files-and-folders.html'>Files and Folders</a></h2>
<p>I started writing this post talking about how I was using <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html">DEVONthink</a>, and, as often happens when you write things down, I started thinking critically about how I interacted with the application. I took a folder full of screenshots, walked through some usage scenarios, and checked and double-checked what I was actually doing with the application. Then I exported everything to the Finder. </p>
<p>As of right now, I’m not using DEVONthink. I’ve gone back and forth over this for literally years. I get enthralled with the idea of building this <em>perfect</em> database, where every bit of information I need is at my fingertips, organized and indexed exactly as I want it. Then after a week or two of day to day use I realize that I’ve duplicated everything that I do with the Finder and a handful of other apps in DEVONthink, and decide to simplify. </p>
<p>One of the best things about DEVONthink is that it doesn’t modify your data, it simply organizes it and adds a layer of intelligence to help you manage it. The main selling point is it’s integrated “AI”, a parsing engine that looks for similarities between documents and can present you with connections between topics you may have missed. In this way, DEVONthink is more of an intelligent research assistant than a document management application like the Finder. Unfortunately, over the past several years of going back and forth, using it and not using it, I’ve never found a practical use for the AI. </p>
<p>I wrote earlier this week about how if you want to remember something you <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/More-Technical-Education">should write it down</a>. Personally, I’ve found that I’m not good at this. I’m far more likely to find a way to record information using my Mac of iPhone than I am a notebook, simply because I’ve always got one of the two with me. I am however making a deliberate effort to give myself time to think clearly, stepping away from the computer and staring out the window for a while. </p>
<p>Computers excel at storing and searching information. Humans excel at making abstract connections between disparate bits of information. The best AI in the world can’t help me if I either don’t trust it, or if I don’t understand the connections it’s trying to make. My own brain is far better at making connections if I only give it the materials it needs. In other words, if I actually read and make notes on the information I’m saving. Using several “anything buckets” over the years I developed a bad habit of saving things after skimming through their contents, thinking that I would have it if I ever needed it. In practice though, instead of searching my own personal archive, I would almost always just search DuckDuckGo or Google again. My perfect database becomes a crypt of partially read web archives.</p>
<p>My entire job is managing information. What commands to type in where to get the desired result. Which buttons to click and what code to push to enable my team to get their work done. Every day the Internet is building and rebuilding itself, and my team does their part to help make information available. I even went to grad school for Human Computer Interaction, and learned only that the best way to manage information is “whatever works for you”. Sure enough, what worked for me in grad school was to have a top level folder named “ISU”, and a sub-folder underneath for every class I was in, and then a folder under each class for each assignment, as well as a folder for the videos of all the lectures. The organization was simple and easy to understand. </p>
<p>Again, when I looked through my DEVONthink system, I found that I had recreated everything that the Finder did. I had a database for each major topic or area of life, and folders and subfolders that further refined the topic till I reached the files. For example, my “Research” database contained an “Operating Systems” folder, that contained folders for “Linux”, “BSD”, “OS X”, and “Windows”. My Linux folder contained a folder named “Shared Internals”, and underneath that a folder named “Kernel”. Inside the Kernel folder were documents pertaining to the internals of the Linux kernel. </p>
<p>While I’ve read most of the documents in my database, too many of them I’ve only skimmed. What would be much more useful is a <em><a href="http://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing/">Zettelkasten</a></em>. A Zettelkasten can be thought of as a Wiki with short articles. The point being that while I've been spending a lot of time organizing files, what I really want out of my computer is <em>knowledge</em>. </p>
<p>If you haven't figured it out by now, I'm still working through all of this. I haven't found the one true way to organize your data that I can recommend to everyone. What I learned in school still stands, how you organize your data remains up to you. Whatever works best for you is what you should do. </p>
<p>I think it's good to have original source material on hand, but that source material is only useful if the information it contains is extracted and incorporated into a personal knowledge base. This has been my mistake for too long, to think that simply by saving and skimming over original source material I can increase my knowledge and effectiveness. Tools like Evernote and DEVONthink encourage this kind of digital hoarding by making it easy to save data, but the truth is that there is still no substitute for doing the hard work required to learn. You have to read, reflect, think it through, and write it down. Maybe on paper, maybe not, but without the intermediary step of synthesizing the information you've collected into your own personal system, it's just more junk that needs to be cleaned up.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2016-08-02-More-Technical-Education.html'>Write it Down</a></h2>
<p>If you really want to remember something, write it down. By hand.</p>
<p>There is a growing body of knowledge that shows the benefits of writing things down, and how handwriting is better for learning than typing on a keyboard. It’s unfortunate that these studies come after years of schools pushing to get a computer in the hands of every student, moving quickly to replace pen and paper with bits and bytes. </p>
<p>A 2014 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/03/science/whats-lost-as-handwriting-fades.html">article in the New York Times</a> draws a connection between increased brain activity and handwriting. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When children had drawn a letter freehand, they exhibited increased activity in three areas of the brain that are activated in adults when they read and write: the left fusiform gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior parietal cortex.</p>
<p>By contrast, children who typed or traced the letter or shape showed no such effect. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another article in Science Daily from 2011 reports <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110119095458.htm">similar results in a separate study</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mangen refers to an experiment involving two groups of adults, in which the participants were assigned the task of having to learn to write in an unknown alphabet, consisting of approximately twenty letters. One group was taught to write by hand, while the other was using a keyboard. Three and six weeks into the experiment, the participants' recollection of these letters, as well as their rapidity in distinguishing right and reversed letters, were tested. Those who had learned the letters by handwriting came out best in all tests. Furthermore, fMRI brain scans indicated an activation of the Broca's area within this group. Among those who had learned by typing on keyboards, there was little or no activation of this area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/memory-medic/201303/why-writing-hand-could-make-you-smarter">article in Psychology Today</a> references several studies, focusing mainly on the benefits of cursive writing. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of the benefit of handwriting in general comes simply from the self-generated mechanics of drawing letters. In one Indiana University study, researchers conducted brain scans on pre-literate 5-year olds before and after receiving different letter-learning instruction. In children who had practiced self-generated printing by hand, the neural activity was far more enhanced and "adult-like" than in those who had simply looked at letters. The brain’s “reading circuit” of linked regions that are activated during reading was activated during hand writing, but not during typing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the focuses of my writing here is about the <em>appropriate</em> use of technology to enhance our lives. There are so many things that a computer <em>can</em> do, it’s difficult to know where to draw the line on what we <em>should</em> do. Can we give kids computers and have them type notes in class instead of writing them down? Sure. Should we? It’s looking like the increasingly obvious answer from the scientific community is <em>no</em>. Just because it’s faster doesn’t mean it’s more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>There continues to be no shortcut to deep learning</strong>. To know a subject, you must study it closely. To learn math, you must practice, especially the fundamentals. The best way to take notes during a lecture is by hand, forcing yourself to synthesize the information you are absorbing into a compressed form that captures the essential ideas, pushing your mind to concentrate intently. Then, at night, when it’s time to study the information further, transcribe the notes into your computer, rewording and exploring the topic as you go. Maybe even speak your notes out loud to yourself, engaging more of your senses. </p>
<p>My favorite quote I’ve read in the past few days is from the Science Daily article, where <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110119095458.htm">associate professor Anne Mangen says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our bodies are designed to interact with the world which surrounds us. We are living creatures, geared toward using physical objects -- be it a book, a keyboard or a pen -- to perform certain tasks," </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don’t fully understand the effect widespread use of computers from an early age is going to have on us. It’s important not to lose sight of the real world as we continue to explore the virtual one we’ve created. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2016-07-28-Life_Long_Intellectual_Pursuits.html'>Life Long Intellectual Pursuits</a></h2>
<p>I’ve always been curious. I remember having coffee with my cousin and her boyfriend as a teenager and saying, in my naïvety, that I wanted to know everything about everything, to know all that was knowable. Even then I knew that was impossible, but that didn’t stop me from wanting to know as much about the world as I could. As time went on I started to dive deeply into different subjects, and put off others till I had more time. Now that I’m looking at forty and an ever growing list of things to learn and do, I’m experiencing something new… panic at the thought of running out of time. </p>
<p>I always assumed that I’d have more time later to learn the things that I want to learn. How to play guitar and piano. Ride a horse. Play chess.[^1] Paint <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5Wo1ubuzAE">like Bob Ross</a>. Woodworking. Gardening. Scuba diving. The list goes on. I’ve started wondering about prioritizing these pursuits according to season, time, and, eventually, health. I run today because I want to be healthy enough to keep learning and doing as I get older. </p>
<p>I was thinking about these things over the weekend when I bought new strings for my guitar. I bought the guitar ten years ago with the intention of learning to play, but one thing or another has always come up, and I figured that later was always a better time than now. Last night I was tuning the guitar[^2] and mentioned to my daughter that “someday” I was going to learn how to play it. </p>
<p>“No time like the present!” she said as she left the room. </p>
<p>She’s right. The finger tips of my left hand are sore this morning, because last night I pulled up a YouTube video and started learning how to play. I may not be able to do it, I might not be able to learn everything I want to know or be able to do. I will fail from time to time. But… “if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”[^3]</p>
<p>After all, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller">life is either a daring adventure, or nothing</a>.”</p>
<p>[^1]:   I mean <em>really</em> play chess. I know the basic rules and can play the game, but I’d like to know it in depth.</p>
<p>[^2]:   Or, well, trying to at least. </p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2016-07-27-How_to_Pick_The_Right_App.html'>How to Pick The Right App</a></h2>
<p>Computers are complex tools; designers and developers are always trying to strike a balance between usability and usefulness. I have a theory that over time a computers configuration grows to resemble the mental state of its primary user. Each machine is a unique mix of file and folder organization methods, naming schemes[^1], and application choices. Those choices can reflect the level of technical knowledge and values of the user, but only if the user has made a conscious choice in what apps to use. </p>
<p>A user making the right application choice is empowered in a way that she wasn’t before. Suddenly this opaque machine begins to bend to her will and provide results, she feels the machine working <em>with</em> her and not against her. Tasks which were too complicated are made understandable, and eventually she is able to forget the computer and become enveloped in the flow of her work. Sometimes finding this flow is difficult, but it is almost always worth the effort. </p>
<p>But how can someone find the right app? In this sense, especially in the Mac and iOS ecosystems, we have an embarrassment of riches. Even for something as basic as a word processor, there are several choices for all types of uses. Off the top of my head I can list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Word</li>
<li>Apple Pages</li>
<li>LibreOffice Write</li>
<li>Mellel</li>
<li>Nisus Writer Pro</li>
<li>Scrivener</li>
<li>Ulysses[^2] </li>
<li>Byword</li>
<li>IA Writer</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on. If you are looking for a simple text editor or note taker, the list of available apps is <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/">even more ridiculous</a>. So, what to pick, how can someone make the best choice for themselves that doesn’t waste their time and end up abandoned in frustration?</p>
<p>This is actually two problems. The first is discoverability, or, how to know that an app even exists. This problem is much harder to solve, because the best apps are not always featured in the app store, and do not always show up at the top of a Google search. Personally, I find that immersing myself in the Apple community for the past thirteen years has helped tremendously. Reputable sites like Federico Viticci’s <a href="https://www.macstories.net">MacStories</a>, Jim Dalrymples <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com">The Loop</a>, Shawn Blanc’s <a href="http://thesweetsetup.com">The Sweet Setup</a>, David Sparks’ <a href="http://macsparky.com">MacSparky</a>, Jason Snell’s <a href="https://sixcolors.com">Six Colors</a>, and of course, John Gruber’s <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> are the best places to look for reliable, and personal, application recommendations. I would avoid trying to search in either the Mac or iOS app stores. </p>
<p>Once you have a handful of recommendations for a certain genre, let’s go back to our list of word processors, it’s time to start whittling down the contenders. </p>
<p><em>Aesthetics</em></p>
<p>Like it or not, how something looks will affect how it is used. Look at the screenshots, is the app pleasing to the eye? Can you visualize yourself doing the type of deep work you care about with this tool? If you’ve already installed the app, investigate the view options for hiding toolbars or views. The app should be inviting, a prompt for you to do your best work. </p>
<p><em>Familiarity</em></p>
<p>You could also call this usability. On the Mac, <em>most</em> well-designed apps function in a fairly similar way. There are common keyboard shortcuts that should be standard. In your word processor, start typing. Edit a couple of paragraphs. Does shift-option-left arrow do what you expect?[^3]  Does the app not only look like it belongs on the Mac, does it <em>feel</em> like it belongs? Does it function in a way that gives you the impression it was built with care specifically for the Mac? </p>
<p><em>Reputation</em></p>
<p>The Mac has been <a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=1984.txt&amp;sortOrder=Sort+by+Date&amp;topic=The+Launch">around since 1984</a>, and iOS is coming up on a decade. Developers have had time to build reputations in the industry for themselves and the apps they create. If you like the look and feel of the app, take a few minutes to check into the history of the app and it’s developers. Are they <a href="https://twitter.com/danielpunkass">active in the community</a>? Do they have a <a href="http://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/archived_notes.html">history of supporting their app</a>? Has the app received any recent updates? Are updates regular? What you want to find out here is if you feel you can trust the app to be around for the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>Trusting that the developers care about their app means that they will put the effort in to adopt new features of the operating system as they are announced by Apple, and that they will not <a href="https://forums.plausible.coop/viewforum.php?f=3&amp;sid=8fceb80e324aa20ada5669197e3bbee9">abandon the app</a> so that it eventually stops working. Establishing this trust in your tools is essential in quieting that little voice in the back of your mind that panics when you start using the tool for significant work.  If the developer blogs regularly, is active on Twitter or other social networks, and releases updates to their app on a regular basis, chances are that they care enough about the app, and are personally invested in the app enough to keep going. </p>
<p><em>Data Longevity</em></p>
<p>Depending on the type of work to be done, how you feel about the longevity prospects may or may not be important. For example, I use OmniFocus for day to day task management, but I’m not especially concerned with being able to review todays tasks in twenty years. However, for our word processor example it may be very important to be able to read and edit the papers you are writing today. Maybe you are in grad school and are looking for the right tool to write your thesis, or you are a stay at home dad and want to record your thoughts for your son. How you look at data longevity is dependent on the job to be done.</p>
<p>Choosing open formats is the easiest answer, but may not always be the best for day to day use. Plain text is the most future-proof, but it’s difficult to work with plain text if you want to include images or media alongside the text. To solve this problem, I’ve made the decision to work with tools that can export to an open format, normally PDF, but not necessarily use an open format natively for day to day use. This way, when I’m done writing that important paper I can hit the export button, or print to PDF, and I have a reasonable safe way to save my important information in a way that should be readable at any point in the future. </p>
<p><em>fin</em></p>
<p>I hope this helps, it works for me. There are probably many more aspects to choosing an application that I didn’t list here. Price and income model come to mind. Let me close with this list of companies that are worth looking into:</p>

<p>I got back from my morning run today and was sitting on the back porch, enjoying the morning air and the feeling of contentment I get after a great run. I logged my run in Day One, and noticed a voicemail from yesterday that I hadn't dealt with yet. </p>
<p>Lifeserve Blood Center. I'm a regular donor. Or at least I was till I started working from home. My office, when I had one, was five minutes away from the closest Lifeserve location, so it was pretty easy to run down at lunch and spend an hour donating platelets. Now it's a half-hour to forty minute drive. I had avoided the call. </p>
<p>Feeling as good as I did though it seemed like a good time to listen to the call. The caller had left an impassioned message, and I was moved once again to do something. I decided to make a day of it to head to town and make this part of the trip. But I couldn't make the call to schedule an appointment at 6:30 AM, I had to put this into OmniFocus to deal with it at the right time. Each voicemail in iOS has a little share icon, and when I hit that icon I fully expected to be able to drop a link to the voicemail straight into OmniFocus. But OmniFocus was missing.</p>
<p>Thinking I had missed it or did something wrong I went through again and searched, no OmniFocus choice. At this point Federico Viticci came to mind and I opened Workflow. </p>
<p>Workflow was probably at the top of my mind at the moment because I had just used it to log my run to Day One. I use the Today View in iOS to launch a Workflow that asks me a few questions, snaps a picture, and pastes all of it into Day One in my Running journal. So far I've got 202 runs stored this way. </p>
<p>I knew Workflow had OmniFocus support, and I knew individual Workflows could be saved as action extensions for inclusion in the share sheet. All I needed was an action that could take any input, create a new OmniFocus task, and add the input as an attachment to the task. </p>
<p><a href="/media/vm-of-workflow.jpg"><img src="/media/vm-of-workflow_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Workflow took care of this in one step. Like <a href="http://leancrew.com/all-this/2016/03/dont-forget-simple-automation/">Dr. Drang once said</a>, "These embarrassingly simple bits of automation are often the most useful."</p>

<p>A few years ago I adopted <a href="http://macsparky.com/paperless/">David Sparks' paperless workflow</a>. I installed Hazel and TextExpander, bought a ScanSnap scanner, and started dutifully scanning all of my paper that came in the mail. I scanned the water bill, my bank statements, and notices from my son's second grade teacher about upcoming snack days. Over the years, and 2000 documents later, I've got a massive database of useless facts. </p>
<p>Never once have I actually <em>needed</em> to go back and look at what my home phone bill was last September. Even less have I needed to know what the schedule was for March in the third-grade classroom. I became so enamored by the ability to save everything that I stopped thinking about what I actually needed to save. I was hoarding. </p>
<p>Like any hoarder, I justified my activities. Why did I spend an hour every other week scanning things into my Mac? Why, for the most basic reason of all... <em>I might </em><em>need</em><em> that someday!</em> Eventually my Spotlight searches became nearly useless, as every keyword was littered with results from my OCR'd scans, useless information I didn't need to keep. </p>
<p>So, today I staged an intervention for myself. I archived everything and started from scratch[^1]. With <a href="http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/3177/how-long-should-i-keep-my-bills">the help of stackexchange</a>, I now have a sane plan for what to keep and for how long. Some things will still get scanned, like reciepts for large purchases and the kids artwork that we can't bear to part with. For the most part though, the paper will come in, live in my drawer for a month or so, and then move on out. </p>
<p>The new system will take some getting used to, but in the end I think I'll be happier and better organzied for it. There's no need to keep things I'm never going to look at again, physically or digitally. </p>
<p>[^1]: Archived, not deleted. Oh, I've still got everything. I mean, I'm not <em>crazy</em>.</p>

<p>Turn it all off. </p>
<p>I've deleted the twitter apps from my phone and computer, I don't log into Facebook anymore, and I'm limiting when I read news outside of the tech news to once a week. It just became too much, I started feeling angry all the time, and reading more news wasn't making me feel any better about it. There was nothing I could do about how I felt, there were no actions I could take to assuage the pain. The constant flow of new events across the world to be outraged about is too much for anyone to handle. </p>
<p>So, I've started myself on a strict information diet. Unless the news is related to Apple or the tech industry, or any of my hobbies,[^1] I'm leaving it till Saturday morning after I've gone on a long run. </p>
<p>There is plenty of evidence that binging on news is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/19/violent-media-anxiety_n_6671732.html">detrimental to your health</a>. In the past few months I've noticed my mental state has grown significantly more pessimistic about the state of the world, when in truth my personal circumstances have never been better.[^2]  </p>
<p>That's not to say that the issues in the world right now are not serious, or that I don't care about the many, many problems affecting our society. I do. I care enormously. I simply can't let how much I care dictate how I feel about everything else. I'm not cutting myself off completely, I'm simply making a decision for myself about when and how much of the news I'll allow in. When the time comes for action, I'll take it.[^3] I just don't need to be reminded about what I already know over, and over, and over. </p>
<p>Sometimes the best thing to do for your own mental health is to log off. </p>

<p>I'm in the process, a very long process, of switching from Vim to BBEdit as my primary editor. The reasons are long and varied, but boil down to me being tired of screwing around with Vim's configuration. I do a lot of work in Python now, and I'm using the experience of building and maintaining cloudchain to learn how to navigate BBEdit. Hopefully, someday I'll be as good here as I was with Vim. </p>
<p>Today I learned that BBEdit ships with support for ctags, best <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/whatis.html">defined by the documentation</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ctags generates an index (or tag) file of language objects found in source files that allows these items to be quickly and easily located by a text editor or other utility. A tag signifies a language object for which an index entry is available (or, alternatively, the index entry created for that object).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tag file serves two purposes. First, BBEdit will use the tags to allow you to jump to the point in your project where the selected function was defined. Second, if you copy the tags file to a specific spot, BBEdit will use that file for code autocompletion. </p>
<ul>
<li><code>⌘-</code> -&gt; Find the definition of the selected function.</li>
<li><code>⌘⎇[</code> -&gt; Jump back to the point you were at in the previous file (if the function was defined elsewhere).</li>
</ul>
<p>To generate the tags file, open your project directory in Terminal and run <code>bbedit --maketags</code>. Then copy the resulting tags file to <code>~/Application Support/BBEdit/Completion Sources/Python/tags</code>. Quit and restart BBEdit and autocompletion and function definition should both work.</p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2016-07-14-cloudchain.html'>cloudchain</a></h2>
<p>Today, the team I'm a part of at TargetSmart is releasing our <a href="https://github.com/targetsmart-devops/cloudchain">first open source project</a>, a bit of Python I like to call "cloudchain". cloudchain is designed to make it easy to store and retrieve secrets using AWS. cloudchain relies on the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/?tag=duckduckgo-osx-20">Key Management Service</a> (KMS) to securely store and manage access to encryption keys, and stores the encrypted secret in a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">DynamoDB</a> table.</p>
<p>Part of the reason, if not the biggest reason, we are open sourcing this project is to request feedback from the community. cloudchain itself is only a few lines of glue plugging together a few AWS services, but its <em>the idea itself</em> that I'd like vetted. We are using this in a few projects internally, and so far it's worked out. However, I know that there are things I haven't thought of, and ways to improve the process, so I'm hoping others will be able to look at the project with fresh eyes and see things we haven't. </p>
<p>There are three steps in the process. First, cloudchain retrieves an encryption key from KMS and uses it to encrypt the plain text secret. The boto3 library used returns a dictionary with a "Ciphertext" entry containing the encrypted key. cloudchain then base64 encodes the encrypted key into a string, and saves that string to a DynamoDB table named, by default, "safedb". </p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p><code>pip install cloudchain</code></p>
<p>A new encryption key should be created in KMS. Using the console makes this easy, and sets up permissions to the key using IAM users or Roles. IAM users should be given permission individually, while instances launching in AWS should be identified by a role. </p>
<p>A new DynamoDB table should be created as well. Run this command using the AWS CLI tools:</p>
<pre><code>aws dynamodb create-table \
--table-name safedb \
--attribute-definitions \
AttributeName=Service,AttributeType=S \
AttributeName=Username,AttributeType=S \
--key-schema \
AttributeName=Service,KeyType=HASH \
AttributeName=Username,KeyType=RANGE \
--provisioned-throughput \
ReadCapacityUnits=1,WriteCapacityUnits=1
</code></pre>
<p>This will create the DynamoDB table with two attributes: Service and Username. cloudchain assumes that the combination of a service and a username will require a unique secret. The first time a secret is written to the table the third "Secret" attribute is created. </p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The cloudchain cli, <code>cchain</code>, looks for a configuration file at <code>~/.cchainrc</code>. This should be a standard Python ConfigParser compatible file with the following format:</p>
<pre><code>[dynamo]
region_name = us-east-1
endpoint_url = https://dynamodb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
tablename = safedb

[IAMKMS]
keyalias = alias/key
</code></pre>
<p>The "keyalias" should be the name of the KMS encryption key created during the setup, prefixed by "alias/". The "endpoint_url" should point at the closest HTTPS endpoint, or at localhost if using a local development environment. </p>
<h2>Import cloudchain as a Module</h2>
<p>Both the <code>test.py</code> unit tests and the <code>cchain</code> cli import <code>cloudchain.py</code>. After importing, cloudchain expects four variables to be set:</p>
<ul>
<li>region_name</li>
<li>endpoint_url</li>
<li>tablename </li>
<li>keyalias</li>
</ul>
<p>Reasonable defaults are mentioned in the configuration section above, but the <code>keyalias</code> must be unique. </p>
<p>After importing, cloudchain can be called on to encrypt and decrypt secrets:</p>
<p>To Encrypt:</p>
<p><code>cloudchain.savecreds(args['service'], args['user'], args['save'])</code></p>
<p>To Decrypt: 
<code>cloudchain.readcreds(args['service'], args['user'])</code></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>service = The service name the username and secret are associated with</li>
<li>user = The username</li>
<li>save = The unencrypted secret to encrypt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Command Line Use</h2>
<p>The command line script supports five arguments:</p>
<pre><code>  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u USER, --user USER  User name
  -e SERVICE, --service SERVICE
                        Service or application
  -s SAVE, --save SAVE  Save password to the safe
  -r, --read            Read password from the safe
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code>--save</code> and <code>--read</code> arguments are mutually exclusive, and cannot be used at the same time. </li>
<li><code>--save</code> expects the unencrypted secret as an argument, and requires both <code>--user</code> and <code>--service</code> flags.</li>
<li><code>--user</code> expects the username as an argument.</li>
<li><code>--service</code> expects the service name as an argument.</li>
<li><code>--read</code> requires no arguments, and requires both <code>--user</code> and <code>--service</code> flags.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>To save a secret:</p>
<p><code>./cchain -u testuser --service testservice --save testsecreet</code> </p>
<p>To retrieve a secret:</p>
<p><code>./cchain -u testuser --service testservice --read</code></p>
<p>We hope this is useful, and that we can continue to make cloudchain better, easier to use, and more secure as development continues. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2016-05-12-Standing_Desk_Review.html'>Standing Desk Review</a></h2>
<p>For the past two months I've been working, on and off, with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015GCGOD8?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01">Rocelco Height Adjustable Standing Desk Riser</a>, a less expensive choice for working at a standing desk than the popular <a href="http://www.varidesk.com">VARIDESK</a>. The Rocelco is a solid alternative for budget conscious workers, but as with most products, the drop in price comes with a set of trade-offs. </p>
<p><a href="/media/rocelco.jpg"><img src="/media/rocelco_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Having worked for several months with a VARIDESK, and the past two with the Rocelco, my opinion is that the VARIDESK is simply a better product, and will probably stand up better over the course of several years. The Rocelco does what it advertises, it raises the monitor and keyboard tray up to a reasonable level that feel appropriate to my height. However, the pistons it uses to raise the desk are so strong that you can't simply pull on the top to raise it and stand away while the desk raises itself. If you do the top shoots up with enough force that when it reaches it's full height it stops suddenly and shakes. </p>
<p><a href="/media/rocelco_piston.JPG"><img src="/media/rocelco_piston_thumb.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>The first time this happened I was a bit afraid for my monitor. It even managed to shake the desk out of position slightly. If I had a cup of coffee on the desk I'm sure it would have splashed out. The pistons are <em>strong</em>. Once I realized this I remembered from then on to guide the desk to the standing position. </p>
<p>There are no alternative desk heights with the Rocelco, not without engaging the desk locks on each side of the structure. Where the VARIDESK has set points along the path of the raise, the Rocelco has one smooth transition from collapsed to fully expanded, although at any point along the way the locks could, theoretically, be engaged to lock the desk at a specific height, with the mechanics of how the desk raises it would be awkward at best. I've not bothered to try.  </p>
<p><a href="/media/rocelco_unlocked.jpg"><img src="/media/rocelco_unlocked_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I'm a bit worried about the long-term prospects of the keyboard tray. The tray seems to be sitting an eighth of an inch lower than it was when I first unpacked the desk, and pulling up on the tray shows that it's developed a bit of play to it. After two months of on and off use I would expect it to remain solid, I'm not sure what shape it will be in after a year or two. Also, neither the tray nor the desk seem solid enough to support me leaning on it, which, honestly, is a good thing. I shouldn't be leaning on the desk while working anyway. </p>
<p><a href="/media/rocelco_keyboard.JPG"><img src="/media/rocelco_keyboard_thumb.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>Since switching to a sanding desk <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/09-24-2015/standing-desk.html">last year</a> I've become accustomed to long periods of standing, and walking around my office to think and work through problems. While I think the Rocelco is a fine starter desk, neither the aesthetics nor the mechanics of it make me happy enough not to start planning it's replacement. For the next version I'm leaning heavily towards The Wirecutter's recommendation of the <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-standing-desk/">Jarvis Bamboo</a>, but I'm also considering a drafting desk like <a href="http://www.drbunsen.org/setting-up-a-standing-desk/">Dr. Bunsen's</a>.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2016-03-07-The_New_Setup.html'>The New Setup</a></h2>
<p><a href="/media/IMG_0716.jpg"><img src="/media/IMG_0716_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Starting a new job working from home gave me the opportunity to evaluate exactly what I wanted from my work environment. I knew I was getting a new Mac (13” Retina MBP, as you do), but I also knew that I needed a new monitor and standing desk. </p>
<p>I worked for a few weeks using nothing but a 15” rMBP on my desk at home, and found that my right wrist was starting to hurt after only a few hours. I’ve had run-ins with RSI before, and had to wear a brace and adjust my posture while typing to relieve it. While my desk works well for the occasional work day at home, spending a few weeks sitting at it proved to me that it’s insufficient for serious extended periods of concentrated work. </p>
<p>However, I was ruined after looking at the beautiful retina screen for as long as I did. At my previous job I used an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Thunderbolt_Display">Apple Thunderbolt Display</a>, which was beautiful and functional, but had lower DPI than the MacBook display, and was not very adjustable. The Thunderbolt could power the MacBook, and acted as a hub for anything that I needed to plug in, like network cable or external hard drive. The Thunderbolt is also $1,000. Given that I look at text all day, and sometimes into the night, I wanted a display that equaled my MacBook, had adjustable height, and wouldn’t break the bank. After researching a few alternatives, I settled on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dell-Monitor-P2415Q-24-Inch-LED-Lit/dp/B00PC9HFNY">Dell Ultra HD 4K Monitor P2415Q 24-Inch Screen LED-Lit Monitor</a>at less than half the price. </p>
<p>I’ve read about Dell’s Ultrasharp line before, and always came away with the impression that they were very high quality. The 24” screen has a resolution of 3840 x 2160, the same as the next step 27”, which means the pixels are at a much higher density. After using this one for the past week, I can say that the screen itself is superb. There are no dead pixels, text is crisp and clear, colors are sharp, and the matte finish means that I’m not  inadvertently staring at my reflection when working in a dark color scheme. </p>
<p>The screen adjusts to a height level with my eyes, so I’m not hunched over or looking down while working. It also rotates 90°, which I tried briefly and discarded. Just too weird. </p>
<p>While I’m perfectly satisfied with the screen, I do miss quite a few of the niceties of the Thunderbolt Display. There are no integrated speakers, no FaceTime camera, no ethernet port, and no power adaptor for the MacBook. It’s just a monitor. It does have a USB hub, and apparently the display port is capable of carrying audio, but neither feature is integrated into the Mac enough to be useful. For example, if my Time Machine drive was plugged into the monitor when the monitor went to sleep, the drive would be lost to OS X and I’d get that annoying alert about not ejecting a drive. If I need to do video or audio conferencing I’m either going to have to take the Mac out of it’s <a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/product/bookarc-for-macbook-pro-retina">Twelve South BookArc</a> or I’m going to need to plug in a USB camera, microphone, and speakers like it’s 2003. </p>
<p>I mentioned that the display port can carry audio. The monitor has a speaker jack on it, and I at first plugged in my desk speakers into that, but when I did the Mac lost all capability to control the volume output to the speakers. Hitting F11 or F12 showed an image on the screen indicating that the Mac was just shrugging it’s shoulders. Nothing it could do. Plugging the speakers back into the Mac and setting the headphone jack as the default audio out port solved this issue. I had to remind myself… it’s just a monitor. </p>
<p>The last part of the puzzle is still being shipped. I ordered an adjustable standing desk similar to a VariDesk, but made by a Canadian company for, again, about half the cost. I have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015GCGOD8?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01">32” Rodelco ADR</a> on the way, and I imagine I’ll once again be standing for about three-quarters of the day. I spent several months standing while working at my previous job, and I miss that more than the Thunderbolt display. I’ll post again after I’ve worked with it for a week or so with my first impressions. </p>
<p>The 13” is a big change from the 15”, but I don’t feel like I’m missing anything. The 15” seemed an odd size to me. Too big to comfortably use apps full screen, but too small to be able to see more than two windows at the same time. The 13” is perfect for concentrating on a single task, is super light and easy to carry, and has enough power to push the incredible number of pixels on the Dell screen. So far I’m pretty happy with my new setup. </p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2016-02-24-why-blog.html'>Why Blog?</a></h2>
<p>Monday I was offered a new position, yesterday I accepted it. I’m hoping that this is the last time I’ll have to look for a job for a very, <em>very</em> long time. Having an unexpected change in  your career and having to search for a new job is one of the most stressful things a person can do. It was hard, I didn’t sleep well. </p>
<p>I did get to talk to a lot of interesting and smart people though, and got a view of what their challenges were and what their company was like. Most of the people I spoke with were at a company that was growing fast, and they were looking for help scaling and automating their infrastructure, something I’ve come to specialize in. I applied for thirty-four positions, got back twenty-one responses, spoke with twelve companies, and found three positions where I was a near perfect fit. </p>
<p>Of the companies I spoke with, one of the common themes I heard again and again was “I read your blog.” Through my writing here they were able to take a look back through my history, understand how I convey information, and generally get to know me better. One of the first things I did after I started the search was write two blog posts explaining how I came to be where I am in my career, and what I believe DevOps to be. </p>
<p>Writing these posts served two functions. Most importantly it forced me to think through what I was trying to say, to understand what I think about the topic, and convey that in a way that’s concise and understandable. After writing the posts, when the questions inevitably came up during an interview, I was better able to answer without rambling. </p>
<p>I’ve often wondered if keeping this site up was worth my time, my experience during the past month prove, at least to me, that time spent blogging is time well spent. It’s an investment in my future, a calling card to the world. This site is my little corner of the Internet.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2016-02-03-Making_The_Move_From_Sysadmin_to_DevOps.html'>Making The Move From Sysadmin to DevOps</a></h2>
<p>Everyone’s professional path follows a slightly different trajectory. We are each a unique recipe of skills, experience, and interests, which shape who we are and how we come to be in the careers that we have. My experience in moving from a systems administrator to a devops role is unique, because, well, we are all unique. </p>
<p>Somewhere around January of 2010 I saw a shift in the future of the systems administrator role. Automation systems and cloud services were going to change things, and I knew that to stay relevant I was going to have to change too. At the time I felt a bit of an entrepreneurial pull, and decided I was going to be an  independent Mac developer. I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Programming-Mac-4th-Edition/dp/0321774086">the book</a>, set my alarm for an hour earlier each morning, and spent that hour digging through the book learning Cocoa and Objective-C. I did this for months, reading every page, every chapter, and finishing every programming challenge. At the end of the book I started working on my first app, an adoption of a shell script I called “go”. </p>
<p>Go was basically a bookmark manager, but it let you bookmark <em>anything</em> on your Mac. I used it to quickly SSH to servers, mount NFS shares, launch internal management web apps, and other administrative tasks. I was a bit enamored by the delicious generation at the time, and made some rather, well, regrettable UI choices. When the Mac App Store was announced, I knew that I wanted to get my app in there on day one, so I started working right away on version two, or, <a href="https://github.com/ibuys/Go2">Go2</a>. Go2 launched in the MAS in 2011, but never sold enough to make it worthwhile. So, after taking a break from development, I started working on the next app, a static blogging app I called “<a href="https://github.com/ibuys/Paragraphs">Paragraphs</a>”. I worked on this app for months, launched it, watched it fizzle out, and decided I needed to rethink my professional goals. </p>
<p>During this same period I went to grad school for <a href="http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/hci/degree-programs/online-masters/">Human-Computer Interaction</a>. I still saw that I needed to change my professional career path, I was fascinated by design and the science of how we use these machines, and felt it a personal goal of mine to have a graduate degree. So, nights and weekends for two years I was neck deep in a mix of psychology, Adobe Illustrator, OmniGraffle, <a href="https://silverbackapp.com">Silverback</a>, and Python. I graduated with a Masters degree in HCI in 2012, spent a few months at a start up in Des Moines, went back to CDS, and the following year <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/06-06-2013/Farmdog_Co._Sold.html">shut down my development company</a>. All while holding down a full time job and raising a family. To say I was stressed doesn’t even come close. </p>
<p>At CDS I was a Linux sysadmin, but I was also very deeply involved in the design and deployment of the architecture. After my boss quit I applied for and was appointed to a new position titled “Systems Architect Consultant”, which was kind of a fancy term for special projects and development. I had been studying automation, cloud architecture, high availability, and the myriad of other topics surrounding devops, but as the systems architect I was solely devoted to researching those topics and designing solutions based on my research. Around the end of my time there CDS sent me to AWS re:Connect, where I was kickstarted into learning just how big AWS was, and the reality of what I foresaw years before hit me with full force. </p>
<p>I could tell that things were not going well at the company though, and two months before a big round of layoffs I made the move to work for a small software shop named Future Health Software as a systems automation engineer. Unfortunately, between the time I interviewed for the position and the time I was hired, the company was acquired by an investment firm that also acquired Future Health’s biggest competitor, Chirotouch. </p>
<p>Not wanting to concern myself with any of the internal politics or rivalries involved in merging two previously competing companies, I dug into my work and learned everything I could about running production workloads on AWS. I kept an open mind, and learned that the AWS systems were meant to be used like a development framework, bootstrapping an application in the most efficient way possible. Of course, most places hadn’t used the service like this, especially the ones that had been using AWS since all that was available was EC2 and S3. So, I set about rebuilding the entire architecture, six years of it, in CloudFormation code, and developing a deployment system based on CodeDeploy. </p>
<p>After several months of setbacks, wrong turns, and distractions of managing the legacy environment, I had a system that could rebuild the entire infrastructure from scratch. I’m quite proud of that work, and hope to someday put it under a production workload. Unfortunately, before I got the chance, the company closed our office and announced that we were going to be let go.  Which brings us to today.</p>
<p>Over the years as I’ve worked out where I want to be in my professional life I’ve learned many different technologies. I’ve spent time digging through the Linux kernel source and reading RFCs, I’ve learned to think pragmatically, read and understand code, and build systems from the ground up. I’ve also learned how the people who use the systems I build actually <em>use</em> them, and how the design choices I make affect the usability and reliability of the system. </p>
<p>For me, the path to get from a sysadmin to a devops engineer travelled from Unix to Linux, through Cocoa and Objective-C, past Python and PHP, stopping in HCI, design, and UX, back to Linux, Docker, and now on to the cloud. And you know, what? It’ll never stop. The tech industry moves fast, you’ve got to keep learning your entire life to stay on the right side of that wave. You’ll either ride it, or be crushed by it, but it’ll never stop. </p>
<p>So, be open to learning new things, try something out of the ordinary, push yourself to try something you haven’t done before, and always <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/05-14-2008/the-master-craftsman.html">do your absolute best</a>. I promise it’ll be a heck of a ride.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2016-02-02-DevOps_-_Evolving_Systems_Administration.html'>DevOps & Evolving Systems Administration</a></h2>
<p>The phrase “DevOps” gets thrown around quite a bit, so I thought it might be helpful for me to write down exactly what it means to me. DevOps is the evolution of <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/02-24-2009/systems-administrator.html">systems administration</a>. A few years ago, I noticed that the SysAdmin field was finally starting to change, after years of being relatively static. For decades, A sysadmin would set up the hardware, install the operating system, setup SSH (or, telnet in the bad old days), install your application, and get it running. Even when virtualization became more mainstream and worked its way into production workloads, it didn’t change the core tasks of a sysadmin. There were simply more boxes to manage, and without appropriate configuration management, each virtual machine became a unique little snow flake. A few tools became more commonplace like CFEngine, Puppet, or Chef to ease the burden of virtual machine sprawl, but it wasn’t until cloud computing came along that the role of a sysadmin really started to change.  </p>
<p>I realized that the traditional role of a sysadmin was going to change over next few years, and I needed to be on the right side of the this wave of change. Today’s sysadmin needs to know code – because the entire infrastructure is based on code. DevOps as a concept means to me that the mindset of a traditional sysadmin in a data center wasn’t going to cut it for the kind of skills needed for the new environment. Hardware doesn’t matter, operating systems don’t matter, the only thing that matters is the ability to run the application, and run it in a way that is stable, scaleable, and secure. </p>
<p>One has to completely change the way they think about infrastructure. A common flaw that I’ve seen is trying to treat AWS like your data center. AWS will let you do that, gladly, but it will be expensive. It’s utility computing, like water. You get your water from the local water company, and you pay for what you use. The water company will let you turn on your faucet and just run water all day, but it will charge you for it and you will pay for far more than what you actually need. That’s why you have to have tooling, in this example a faucet to turn the water off and on. In a similar manner, you need automation systems in your infrastructure to scale up and down as needed.  </p>
<p>The other part of the evolution is that you have to stop thinking of the infrastructure as a systems administration task, and instead think of AWS and other cloud providers more like an application programming framework. Tying into building blocks like legos, and picking the appropriate parts to run your application. </p>
<p>Systems administration is evolving in the same way programming languages have, building up to ever higher layers of abstraction. DevOps is simply working with the developers to build the best possible system to run the application. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2016-01-29-Everything_Changes.html'>Everything Changes</a></h2>
<p>And everything is changing for me again. The CTO of the company I work for spoke with me yesterday, our office is being shut down and they are laying off the staff. I’ve got till March 1st to find something new. </p>
<p>If anyone is looking for a good devops guy, let me know!</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2016-01-26-Mac_Power_Tools.html'>Mac Power Tools</a></h2>
<p>My brief experiment with mutt ended mostly how I expected it would. With me turning on my email in Mail.app again and carrying on as normal. I try to understand the draw to using such an archaic tool as mutt, but there’s simply nothing about it that appeals to me. Not at this stage of my life anyway. </p>
<p>This time someone emailed me a PDF that I needed to sign and send back to her. A simple process with Mail.app, but I knew that I was going to have to jump through hoops and spend an hour reading the documentation to figure out how to respond with an attachment with mutt. Come to think of it, I should amend my previous statement on how well I know the app. I know how to read and organize my email in mutt, and I can use it to build an offline mirror of my hosted email. I can build a search index for it, and send plain text email. I know how to view attachments and how to use a command line web browser to view HTML email. But, the one thing I didn’t know how to do was the one thing I needed to get done. Something trivially simple with the built in mail client. </p>
<p>So, to the wayside it went. While I was at it, I decided to do some cleaning up of the rest of my command line tools as well. I uninstalled everything I had installed with brew with a simple command:</p>
<p>brew uninstall <code>brew list</code></p>
<p>Then I reinstalled the few command programs that I knew I needed for work. </p>
<p>brew install jq jsmin rbenv</p>
<p>This mass uninstall also removed MacVim. Something I’ve had <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/01-28-2013/vim_power.html">conflicting</a> <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/12-23-2015/Winning_NaNoWriMo.html">feelings</a> about for a while now. As I said in my last post, MacVim excels at editing text, but I realize I set up a bit of a straw man comparing it with TextEdit. Obviously TextEdit was never the competition with MacVim, instead, I should have been comparing it with BBEdit and Ulysses, my other two text editors of choice. </p>
<p>Like Vim, BBEdit and Ulysses are power tools, but unlike Vim they are <em>Mac</em> power tools. They are built specifically for the Mac environment, by <a href="http://www.barebones.com/company/">small teams</a> who are dedicated to their craft, and who charge a reasonable, sustainable rate for their product. They approach their jobs in different ways, and are very different applications. BBEdit is built for developers and sysadmins, and has depths of integration and feature set that I’m only just beginning to explore. Ulysses is built for writing prose, and it’s where I’m writing this. Honestly, it’s beautiful. </p>
<p>We live in a blessed era of Mac productivity. We have almost an embarrassment of riches when it comes to incredibly well crafted third party applications, and we still have access to all the low-level Unix tools that attracted me to the platform thirteen years ago. I’ve waffled back and forth over using the old tools and adopting new ones, but I’m getting too old for that. I simply want my tools to work for me. As of right now, I don’t imagine I’ll be going back to mutt, vim, or anything else command line. Not when there are fantastic Mac apps that do the job either just as well, or better. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2016-01-24-Power_Tools.html'>Power Tools</a></h2>
<p>After reading through Matt Gemmell's <a href="http://www.mattgemmell.co.uk/the-dao-of-the-shell/">latest post</a> on mutt and the good doctor's <a href="http://leancrew.com/all-this/2016/01/filing-mail/">response</a>, I fired up my old mutt config and gave it another run through. Well, after being a bit snarky on <a href="https://twitter.com/ibuys/status/689227413037969408">Twitter</a>, of course. </p>
<p>I'm always of two minds when it comes to using Unix tools on a Mac. On the one hand, I want to live in the future, where everything is beautiful and powerful, simple and easy to use, but functional enough to do everything I want. That future might never come, but sometimes it feels as if its right around the corner. On the other hand, I know Unix. I make my living on the command line, and have for years. I've got a customized <code>.vimrc</code> file that's setup <em>just</em> the way I like it. I know how to zip around mutt. I could even setup mpd to play music instead of iTunes if I felt like it. That constant friction of how I wish things were hits up against how I know things are on a daily basis. </p>
<p>I know how to get things done quickly and efficiently, but sometimes I just don't want to do it that way. I want to live in the future, not the past. But, once you know how to use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unix-Power-Tools-Third-Edition/dp/0596003307?tag=duckduckgo-osx-20">power tools</a>, the knowledge will forever be present in the back of your mind, a quiet voice that says "you know how to do this, you know how to make this better". However, it's important to know when to take advantage of a power tool, and to avoid unnecessarily fetishizing the command line. </p>
<p>Living in the Apple ecosystem has benefits. Pictures I put in the Photos app are available everywhere. Likewise with music in iTunes Match. Any document I edit in TextEdit is <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21966?locale=en_US">automatically versioned</a> without my needing to think about it. Apple designs their products to work well together, but they also design them to appeal to the largest audience possible, which may or may not include me.</p>
<p>Take TextEdit as an example. It's a basic text editor, it can edit a Markdown document just fine, but when I edit Markdown in <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/08-04-2011/Text_Editing_in_MacVim.html">MacVim</a> I've got access to my years of keyboard navigation and key combos for doing things like inserting links and switching between inline links and reference links. As previously mentioned, TextEdit automatically versions it's documents, but with a couple of modifications, so does MacVim. TextEdit is a general purpose tool, MacVim is a power tool, they are not really in the same category, except they can both edit a text document. </p>
<p>Maybe that's the differentiation I've been searching for. TextEdit can, as it's name implies, edit text files, but MacVim <em>excels</em> at it. Mail can send and receive email, it's a general tool best for most people. Mutt is a power tool, best for specific use cases when you already have the background knowledge to be able to take advantage of it. </p>
<p>Knowing how to use the power tools will make you a better computer user. Knowing when to use a particular tool, and knowing which tool is the best one for the job, makes you an expert.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-12-28-Mac_Magazine.html'>Mac Magazine</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes I think I’d like a really great magazine, like The New Yorker, but for Mac geeks. A beautifully printed, monthly magazine with all the best news, tips, opinions, analysis, predictions, and howtos from the Mac community. I’m not looking for what Macworld used to be, I’m thinking more along the lines of The Atlantic. Something classy, something worthy of printing and keeping out in the living room under the coffee table. Something I’d look forward to reading cover to cover every month.</p>
<p>Of course, it would have the best of <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a> for the month, something argumentative from <a href="http://marco.org">Marco Arment</a>, and maybe a bit of Mac history from <a href="http://www.512pixels.net">Stephen Hackett</a>. The tech news would be covered by <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com">Jim Dalrymple</a>, <a href="https://sixcolors.com">Jason Snell, and Dan Moren</a>. <a href="https://shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc</a> and <a href="http://mattgemmell.com">Matt Gemmell</a> would add some flavor to the mix, we’d get a taste of the future from <a href="https://www.macstories.net">Federico Viticci</a>, and on the back page would be <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/">Dr. Drang’s</a> script of the month. To be honest, I’d probably read that last page first, and then read the rest of it. Heck, Gruber could call the entire magazine Daring Fireball and color the entire front of the magazine gray with his star lightly embossed in a slightly darker gray and, well, it would be fantastic. </p>
<p>Perhaps it’s a bit silly to be dreaming of a magazine at the end of 2015, but it’s something that doesn’t exist that I wish did. If I wish it existed, I’m sure there must be others who would like it too. A physical, intentionally designed magazine with beautiful print, carefully chosen advertisements, and pages that felt good when you flipped them. Something that felt like it might be around in a hundred years, if you take care of it. </p>
<p>Of course, as far as I know none of these folks are interested in collaborating on such an endeavor. Each of them is building their own business, building membership programs and selling ads. I added up a few of my favorite sites membership programs to see what the monthly total would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Six Colors $6/mo</li>
<li>The Loop $3/mo</li>
<li>MacStories $5/mo</li>
<li>Relay.fm $5/mo</li>
<li>Shawn Blanc $4/mo</li>
<li>Matt Gemmell $4/mo</li>
<li>Brooks Review $4/mo</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: $31/mo</p>
<p>For comparison, the New York Times sells for $35 per month for the “All Digital Access” package. You can subscribe to The New Yorker for less than five dollars per month, and subscribing to The Atlantic for a year equates to paying $2.50 per issue for ten issues. Food for thought. </p>
<p>Of course, I can’t end this dreamy article without mentioning Marco’s ill fated “The Magazine”. What I’m proposing and what The Magazine turned out to be aren’t really in the same ballpark, other than having some of our favorite characters involved in its creation. The Magazine was purposefully not a “tech” magazine, it was about writing. It was also not a printed magazine, it was a subscription digital magazine aimed at the iPad’s Newsstand app. What I’m proposing is an old fashioned printed magazine, about tech, with my personal favorite writers, superbly designed and excellently illustrated. It would be awesome. </p>
<p>So, of course it will never exist.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-12-23-Winning_NaNoWriMo.html'>Winning NaNoWriMo</a></h2>
<p>So, I won <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWrimo</a>, and wrote a “novel”. Although, it’s not <em>really</em> a novel, more like a novella, and it’s not <em>really</em> written just yet, it’s 50,000 words that somewhat make up a complete story, but with more plot holes than you can shake a stick at. Couple that with the number of inconsistencies in the world building, flat characters, characters who’s names I forget half way through the writing, and two chapters that I decided I was going to throw away completely, and you’ve got what is colloquially known as a first draft. </p>
<p>Here’s how I did it. </p>
<p><em>Minimize Decisions</em></p>
<p>If you've read my old posts, you might have picked up that I was once a big fan of Vim and the command line. Those days have past. Vim can be fun, but it can also be one of the biggest time sinks I’ve ever encountered. Can you write long form in Vim? Sure, but it takes more self discipline than I have to not try to tweak the configuration <em>just a little bit more</em>. </p>
<p>Instead, I wrote my story using the excellent <a href="http://ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a> editor, “a powerful tool made for writers.” In fact, I’m using it to write this right now. </p>
<p><em>Set Daily Goals</em></p>
<p>My favorite feature of Ulysses is the word count goal. To win NaNoWriMo you need to write at least fifty-thousand words in thirty days. So, divide fifty-thousand by thirty and you get one-thousand six-hundred sixty-seven words per day. I set up thirty “sheets” in Ulysses, and attached the daily word goal to each one. I labeled each sheet as a chapter, and wound up with three acts of ten chapters each. </p>
<p>When I sat down to write each day, I wrote until the Ulysses goal circle turned green and wrapped up the chapter. Being able to keep an eye on the daily goal, and knowing that if I met it the circle would turn green gave me a great sense of accomplishment throughout the month. I always knew how much I had to write, and that I was on track. </p>
<p><em>Enforce Focus</em></p>
<p>If left to my own devices I’m perfectly happy to check Twitter every ten to fifteen minutes. Or seconds, depending on the day. I knew that I was going to have to give up everything distracting and time wasting to focus completely on writing. To help I signed up with <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a>. RescueTime tracks how you use your computer, and sends you an email with weekly reports on how you’ve spent your time. You can classify websites or apps as highly productive or time wasters, and you can use the “Get Focused…” feature to block time wasting sites for a specified period of time. I’d shoot for an hour at a time of enforced focus, and wound up getting a lot done.</p>
<p><em>Prepare</em></p>
<p>Months before NaNoWriMo started, I started brainstorming in <a href="https://mindnode.com">MindNode</a> and outlining my plans in <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner">OmniOutliner</a>. I used these two tools to explore the universe I was building, flesh out characters and motivations, define a (somewhat) cohesive plot, and plan out a chapter by chapter flow of what should be going on at a given point in the story. </p>
<p>It didn’t take long for the story to take on a life of it’s own and diverge from the outline I so meticulously wrote up, but knowing it was there was a <em>huge</em> mental safety net, I knew that no matter how far off course I got, if I needed to I could refer back to the outline and get the story back to where it needed to be. </p>
<p><em>BIC</em></p>
<p>More than one night I nearly didn’t meet my goal. I had nights where each and every word had to be pulled kicking and screaming out of my head and through my hands. I had nights where I was so tired that I literally fell asleep while typing, and had to go back and remove the gibberish on the screen. Then again, I had nights where the story almost wrote itself, where I was merely the conduit for the story to be told, and the goal was met in an hour or so. The important thing was that no matter what, I was writing. Every day. </p>
<p>Sit down and write, lose yourself in the story, get excited about action, and be thoughtful during introspective scenes. Most of all, just keep writing. Don’t edit, don’t worry and fuss over sentence structure, there will be plenty of time for that after November. Put your butt in the chair and <em>write</em>.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-12-23-US_Cellular_Strikes_Back.html'>US Cellular Strikes Back</a></h2>
<p>Let me start by saying that US Cellular has the best coverage in Iowa. No matter where we go in the state, we’ve got a great signal, almost always in LTE. My Internet access is fast, and I can’t remember the last time I dropped a call. The cellular service is great, and the only reason I stick with US Cellular. After days like today I need to remind myself of these facts, because almost every time I interact with them face to face, on the phone, or over the Internet I leave frustrated and feeling like I’m being duped. </p>
<p>I got an advertisement email from them a week or so ago. That in itself is questionable because I’m sure I unsubscribed, but whatever, we’ll leave that alone for now. The email’s subject line advertised “<em>Act now and we’ll waive the Activation Fee – a $25 value!</em>” Knowing that my wife and daughter were due for new phones I forwarded the email to her and suggested that maybe now was the right time. She agreed, and the first chance the two of us had time we headed to our closest store. We’ll call this Store Number One.</p>
<p>The staff at Store Number One were knowledgeable, pleasant, and courteous. We came in, sat down, told her that we wanted to upgrade two lines, and she went to get the 16GB iPhone 6S. At the mention of the 16GB model I hit the brakes, I knew that would not be enough for her, she has a 16GB model now and it’s too full to work properly. We asked for the 64GB version, but they didn’t have any in stock. The woman we were working with was kind enough to call around to several of the other stores in town, and finally found one with a few in stock that was only a ten to fifteen minute drive from where we were. We thanked her for her help and left for Store Number Two.</p>
<p>Store Number Two was nearly empty, and we were sat down right away. The store had the right phones in the right sizes in stock, and we were ready to close the deal. Then my wife remembered the email about waving the activation fee, and we asked if they would honor the advertisement. The agent didn’t know anything about it, and asked if I still had a copy of it. I did, (in my email trash, but I still had it), and he took my phone to show the email to his manager. They talked for quite a while, and the manager decided that they couldn’t honor the no activation fee in the store, but said if we went online we could get it there. We talked it over briefly and decided that it was probably a good idea to save $50 and wait a day or two and headed home to get online, Store Number Three.</p>
<p>While online with Store Number Three, I noticed in my account that it didn’t appear that the correct discount was being applied to one of our lines. At this point, I need to make a brief digression to explain the importance of this particular discount. </p>
<p>US Cellular, like all the other major carriers, has shifted away from subsidizing smart phones and instead is financing. To offset the price of financing the phone, US Cellular is offering to discount the normal $40 monthly “connection fee” per line down to $20. Then the financing of the phone costs $15-$30 or so, making the offer more desirable because the monthly cost of owning the phone stays roughly the same. </p>
<p>When I looked at my bill online, I didn’t see the discounted connection fee, I saw the full $40 fee <em>and</em> the finance charge for the phone. I knew this was wrong, so I clicked on the live customer support chat button and was connected with a representative. I explained my situation as best as I could, and she did the appropriate amount of checking. She found two problems: one, the online view I was seeing did not reflect the correct connection fee, but the view she was seeing did. The line I was asking about was getting the discounted fee. And two, the other two lines on my account were not getting the discounted fee, and should have been. She corrected this issue, and I was happy to move along, although I was still a bit apprehensive that what I was seeing online was not representative of reality. I even pulled up a recent bill and started going through it to make sure it was correct there. </p>
<p>Once I was happy enough with the existing monthly bill, I asked the representative in chat about waiving the activation fee, like the associate in the store said. Apparently I was misinformed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do apologize that isn't accurate you will still get charged the activation fee for the phone it is $25.00 when you finance. I apologize for the information that was provided. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, great, so we could have stayed at the store in town and bought the phones there. No saving $50 today I guess. But, just to make sure, I asked her about the email I got. She responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you received an email with that information did it give you a promo code with it? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>“If”? What do you mean “if”? I looked through the email and didn’t see a promo code, but I did find some type of code at the bottom of the email. I sent that to her but she couldn’t find anything, so she asked me to forward the email to her, which I did. She then disappeared for a while, and came back with the final answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you so much for holding we didn't find that promotion but, that is only if you get the tablet and the activation fee for the tablet would be waived that isn't for the cell phones. I do apologize. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which I said that it wasn’t clear from the email at all that the offer was only for an Android tablet. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Awesome have I addressed all of your concerns for you today?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Awesome. </p>
<p>So, we went through three stores, three representatives, and found at least four errors in the US Cellular system. It seems to me that at least one of them could have gone ahead and said, “sure, we’ll be happy to honor that email you got, even if it wasn’t originally intended this way.”</p>
<p>I always leave my dealings with US Cellular with the not-so-faint feeling that I’m getting ripped off.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-10-19-Faith,_Hope,_Love.html'>Faith, Hope, Love</a></h2>
<p>What if Christians <em>actually</em> lived the way Jesus commanded us to? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Love your enemy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m afraid we’ve gotten a bad name, mostly because we haven’t been living the way Jesus told us to. Mahatma Gandhi is quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does it take to be like Christ? There are many verses in the Bible that instruct us on how we should live our lives. One of my favorites is Matthew 5, versus 38-48:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>38 “You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ 39 But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. 40 And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. 41 And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. 42 Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.</p>
<p>43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 44 But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? 47 And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? 48 You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These versus are easy to read, but hard to act out. Let someone slap me? Let someone sue me and give him more than what he asks for? Love people who hate me? Maybe I should bake two cakes for the gay couple who asks me for one. Jesus sets a high bar for his followers. I’m not perfect, far from, but I do try to be just a little bit better than the man I was yesterday. Everyday, just a little bit better. How important is love in being a better person? 1 Corinthians 13 explains further. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without love, I am nothing. If we do all these acts without love, they are worthless. But how can I love someone who wants to do me harm? What kind of love is he talking about? The next few versus in 1 Corinthians 13 explain exactly what love is. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
Love never fails.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This next year we are going to be electing a new President in the United States. Election seasons always bring with them divisiveness, but it feels to me like it’s gotten worse in the past few years. As a Christian I feel a certain pressure from other Christians to vote conservative, but when I consider the options I always go back to Jesus’ command to his followers to love each other, to love their neighbors, and to love their enemies. Paul expands on the idea in Romans 12.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. 15 Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. 16 Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul follows it up with a verse that I’ve taken to heart and try to live my life by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>18 If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I should love the people around me, say good things about people who are harsh with me, and live peacefully with everyone.  Does that sound like the standard conservative rhetoric? Well, not to me.</p>
<p>But what if I’m <em>really</em> upset with someone? The world is going down the drain and everything I believe in this country is being  questioned and I feel personally slighted. What then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>19 Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” 20 To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” 21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Never avenge myself. Even if I’ve been wronged, even if I’m put in a situation I don’t agree with, even if I’ve been slapped across the face. It’s not up to me to take an eye for an eye. The Bible very clearly says that is up to God. </p>
<p>On the matter of the clerk who took it upon herself to stop issuing marriage licenses. This is the test for determining where the motives of someones actions originate. Is what is done, done in love? Does the action adhere to the instructions from Jesus? Is it Christian to deny a gay couple a marriage license? If your action does not begin and end with love, but instead you are taking a small amount of vengeance out on someone you have perceived as wronging you, doesn’t that explicitly go against the plain teaching of the Bible? </p>
<p>The Bible explains to us how we should live our own lives. It does not tell us to judge everyone else on how they are not living up to God’s standard. Here’s news, no one is. “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” Christians, including myself, consider homosexual relationships a sin. But, we also consider cursing to be a sin. My understanding is that God does not rank sin, so mine is just as bad as anyone else. The occasional curse word that I might drop under stress is just  as much an affront to God’s holiness as homosexuality. </p>
<p>The argument is not if homosexuality is wrong or not, it’s that each of us are at a different stage in our journey. Some of us are not saved yet and are living in darkness, some of us have been saved by faith in Jesus are are undergoing the slow, transformative process of sanctification. </p>
<p>I don’t think that what the clerk did was right, but I can’t judge her anymore than I can the couples she was denying marriage licenses to. All I can do is watch the world and wonder, what if we all lived the way Jesus told us to? What a magnificent world that would be. What if we could all act with selfless love towards one another? Perhaps, just maybe, Christians should be the light of the world, showing the amazing, transformative power of salvation though Christ. Maybe we could all do a little more of that and a little less judging. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The greatest of these is love.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-10-12-Moby_Dick.html'>Moby Dick</a></h2>
<p>I've been slowly working through my list of books, and Saturday I finally knocked another one off the list, Moby Dick. Herman Melville’s whaling epic took me a while. Inside those 663 pages, there’s probably a good 300 page book, as it is, Moby Dick covers both the human condition and the intricacies of butchering a whale in the middle of the ocean. </p>
<p>I found brief flashes of masterful prose in the book, some familiar quotes from Star Trek movies, and, surprisingly, I found bits of humor towards the start of the book. When Ishmael and Queequeg meet, Ishmael is already in bed when Queequeg comes into the room, undresses and crawls into bed next to him. Ishmael is scared stiff of the strange foreigner, and tries to stay quiet until Queequeg does something to frighten him, Ishmael jumps, and Queequeg jumps, and the entire scene reads like a comedy. </p>
<p>The comedy doesn’t last long though. Once onboard the Pequod the book turns to symbolism, quite a lot of it frankly over my head. I understand the main points. Captain Ahab, driven mad with desire for revenge against the whale that took his leg, sacrifices everything he has and everyone he knows in his monomaniacal pursuit of a single whale in the great, wide ocean. </p>
<p>He does finally find his whale, but between the time that they set sail and the time they finally catch up to the whale, there is a long period of general whaling. In this, we get to find out about the differences between the Right Whale and the Sperm Whale, and why the Sperm Whale is the most fearsome beast in the ocean, and how to kill one when you find it. Not only that, but how to decapitate the whale once killed, strip the blubber from its hide, and stock up the spermaceti for transport. All of this I could have done without. </p>
<p>What I did find interesting was the relationship between Ahab and his first mate, Starbuck. By the end of the book Starbuck wants desperately to return to Nantucket, and call off the hunt for the whale. Ahab, driven solely and completely by his need to kill the white whale refuses. Starbuck considers killing the captain, sneaks into his cabin with his gun and contemplates murder, but he can’t do it. Starbuck can’t allow himself to take another mans life, even if it would have meant saving the lives of everyone else on the ship. </p>
<p>Ahab’s obsession destroys him, and his entire crew, except the one who survived to tell the tale. In the end, Ahab knew he was beat, but he refused to give up. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! Thus, I give up the spear!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purity of Ahab’s obsession is best captured in this famous quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale’s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart’s shell upon it."
- Moby Dick, Herman Melville</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ahab felt that all wrong, all evil, all torment for all of history was the fault of Moby Dick. Crazy, right? </p>
<p>That’s one of the issues I have with the book though. Melville kept telling us how <em>mad</em> Ahab was, but for most of the book he just seemed like a jerk. Obsessive, yes, but crazy? It would have been more interesting to see more of the inner workings of Ahabs mind in the earlier and middling parts of the book than at the end. </p>
<p>I’m glad to have read the book, but I’m not sure I’ll ever read it again. It took months for me to get through, I just kept losing interest. Like <a href="https://twitter.com/blankbaby">McNulty</a> likes to say, there’s probably a fantastic 300 page book inside the 660 pages of Moby Dick.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-09-24-standing-desk.html'>Standing Around</a></h2>
<p>I was having problems with my lower back, not an uncommon issue, especially for those of us who spend our day staring at a computer screen. My problem was exasperated by my poor posture in my chair. I tend to slouch after a couple of hours, and then slowly slide lower and lower into my chair until, at the last moment before I fall out of it, I reposition myself and sit up again. I also run in the morning, and I rarely have time to stretch properly after a run, a bad habit that needs to be addressed. By the end of the day I’d stand up and crack my lower back three or four times, and know that if I turned in the wrong way I would be out of commission for a week or so while my back untwisted itself. </p>
<p>During a trip to our main office in San Diego back in January, I noticed that quite a few people were using VARIDESK adjustable standing desks. Intrigued, I asked around, and after several months of neglect I made the appropriate arrangements. Work was kind enough to furnish me with a <a href="http://www.varidesk.com/standing-desk-pro-plus-36" title="VARIDESK ProPlus 36">VARIDESK ProPlus 36</a> about three weeks ago, and I’ve been standing most of the work day since.</p>
<p>I don’t stand the entire day, and when I do stand I’m not always  typing. I do tend to spend a lot of time at the keyboard, but I notice that I tend to take more breaks to walk around and think things through before returning to the keyboard again. At the end of the day, I’m physically tired, and mentally exhausted. Switching to a standing desk leaves me with a feeling of accomplishing something by the end of the day, and while I’m not sure if I’m being <em>more</em> productive with the standing desk, I do feel that I’m not being noticeably <em>less</em>. The benefit to me is more in how I feel after getting home, I’m ready to rest and be with the family. </p>
<p>The standing desk is adjustable, and takes up a big corner of my normal desk. While it is perfectly comfortable to work on standing up, I now prefer to take my MacBook out of it’s BookArc and work on an empty space beside the adjustable desk and not use the external monitor while sitting down. Mainly because the desk is so big that when it is in the down position it hangs over the inside corner of the desk, and puts the keyboard at an uncomfortable position. Personally I find this to be motivation to spend more time standing. </p>
<p>After three weeks my back is bothering me less, and I don’t have a problem standing for several hours at a time. The long term benefits are yet to be seen, obviously, but my hope is that the standing desk returns a few precious moments of health to my upcoming later years. Meanwhile, I expect to spend a lot of time standing around. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-09-05-netnewswire.html'>NetNewsWire 4</a></h2>
<p><img src="/media/nnw-icon.jpg" />
I’m not sure if I discovered Daring Fireball through NetNewsWire, or <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2002/09/feed_me">NetNewsWire through Daring Fireball</a>. Either way, in my mind the two are inexorably linked to my introduction to the Mac community. A group of people who value usability and good design, typography, readability, and simple good sense. Before the Mac, my thoughts on software were that it was either written by thousands of contributors across the globe, or thousands of drones in basement cubicles. What I learned through NetNewsWire was that individual craftsmen made the best software, and I could get to know them through their work. I started making it a point to follow the people who made the software I used. </p>
<p><a href="http://netnewswireapp.com">NetNewsWire</a> was developed by <a href="http://inessential.com">Brent Simmons</a>, one of the first developers who’s blog I made a point to follow. I followed him as he was <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/10/the_life">hired by NewsGator</a>, and after he left and went independent, and when he sold <a href="https://blackpixel.com/writing/2011/06/black-pixel-acquires-netnewswire.html">NetNewsWire to Black Pixel</a>. Around this time RSS readers hit a rough patch when Google shut down <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/the-end-of-google-reader-sends-internet-into-an-uproar/">Google Reader</a>, the backend syncing engine used by NetNewsWire and many other RSS readers. I wasn’t too worried at the time. Several of the competing apps quickly adopted alternative syncing engines, and I expected NetNewsWire to follow suit. </p>
<p>It didn’t. </p>
<p>Black Pixel decided against supporting third party syncing engines and opted instead to build their own. In the man time, the older version of NetNewsWire atrophied. With no syncing engine the app was isolated, an island that needed to be a peninsula. I wanted to be able to skim the news on my phone or iPad and not have to re-read the same headlines on my Mac. Eventually I abandoned NetNewsWire in favor of ReadKit. ReadKit was <em>almost</em> as nice, but not quite. I still longed for the keyboard navigation and overall ease of use that I’d grown accustomed to. I kept checking in to see if there was progress, but very little was made public. </p>
<p>I’ve given Black Pixel <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/01-19-2013/iCloud_and_Core_Data.html">quite a bit of grief</a> over the past couple of years regarding their treatment of my favorite news app. In my mind it had joined the graveyard of struggling, once amazing, Mac apps along with <a href="http://omnistaging.omnigroup.com/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a>, VoodooPad and Yojimbo. Apps with personality and history, but unfortunately no future. Apps that couldn’t quite make the transition to the iOS era. </p>
<p>I bought a new license straight away when NetNewsWire 4 was first announced. Then there were a few betas, few and far between, followed by a long period of silence. I assumed that the app was not considered profitable or important enough to warrant serious development time. Perhaps Black Pixel considered the purchase of NetNewsWire a mistake, and were happy to brush it under the table and forget. I don’t know. As far as I know that may well be the case, but today I’m running the final released version of NetNewsWire 4, complete with a custom syncing backend and a brand new iOS app. </p>
<p>NetNewsWire 4 feels like a return to NetNewsWire Lite. It lacks the power user features of the old pro version, like custom article styles, but it’s still snappy and responsive. I can still breeze through feeds using the arrow keys, and NetNewsWire still gives me a beautifully subtle highlight that flows through the selected feed when I hit the right arrow to open an article in Safari. Nothing else has ever felt quite right. </p>
<p>Quite a bit has been said about the loss of features in the new version, including wondering just who this app is aimed at. Obviously, it was aimed at me. Well, or someone like me who sees the app for what it is. A rewrite of a legacy system that drops both features and cruft to pour a new foundation to build on. NetNewsWire 4 is simple, but I doubt NetNewsWire 5 will be. Now that they have the base application solid, I hope that Black Pixel will be able to add back in the features missing from version three. </p>
<p>All in all I’m very happy with the few days I’ve spent with NetNewsWire 4. I don’t have anything to say about the iOS version just yet, other than to say that like it’s older brother on the Mac, iOS feels like a new start. With a solid syncing engine, a refined reading experience, and a companion iOS app, NetNewsWire has me wondering if I shouldn’t go check back on some other old favorites.  </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-07-25-Link_Blogging_With_Quicksilver.html'>Link Blogging With Quicksilver</a></h2>
<p>I can't quite make up my mind on how I feel about "link blogging". On the one hand, there's already a lot of people out there who do it better than I can. On the other hand, sometimes I want to share something and make a few pithy comments about it. It's out of that second feeling that this script is born. </p>
<p>The script started out as an Automator action, but having an Automator wrapper around a single shell script seemed like overkill.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

TITLE=`osascript -e 'tell application "Safari" 
    set pageTitle to (do JavaScript "document.title" in document 1)
end tell'`

URL=`osascript -e 'tell application "Safari" 
    set pageURI to (get URL of document 1)  
end tell'`

TEXT=`osascript -e 'tell application "Safari"
set selectedText to (do JavaScript "(window.getSelection().toString())" in document 1)
end tell'`

QUOTEDTEXT=`echo -n "&gt;"; echo -n $TEXT`

LINK=`echo -n [Link]; echo -n \($URL\)`

NAME=`echo $TITLE | sed s/\ /-/g`
USERNAME=`whoami`
POSTNAME=`date "+%Y-%m-%d"-$NAME`   
echo $POSTNAME
POST_FQN=~/Public/Site/_posts/$POSTNAME.markdown

POST_DATE=`date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`

echo "---" &gt;&gt;$POST_FQN
echo "layout: post" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "title: $TITLE" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "date: $POST_DATE" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "---" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN

echo "$LINK" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "$QUOTEDTEXT" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN

echo $POST_FQN

/usr/bin/open $POST_FQN
</code></pre>
<p>That first line is pretty ugly. I don't recall when I wrote this, but it's been working reliably for long enough that I don't feel the need to change it just yet. Then again, a shell script that calls AppleScript that calls JavaScript seems pretty ridiculous.</p>
<p>This script looks at the current web page in Safari and grabs the title, URL, and any selected text and builds a new post in the format my site builder script expects. Similar to my previous New Post script, this one opens the new file in MacVim, ready for writing. </p>
<p>I call the script from Quicksilver using the <code>Run…</code> command, and tied the command to <code>^⎇ ⌘ P</code> for a hotkey. </p>
<p>I might start putting more links on the site. There are often things that I find might be interesting to a certain segment of the Mac community, mainly the more technical and scientific groups, that I haven't done anything significant with. I'd like to change that.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-07-23-Starting_a_New_Post_With_Automator.html'>Starting a New Post With Automator</a></h2>
<p>Automator is one of my favorite tools on the Mac, and unfortunately one of the most unappreciated. I have several workflows and services that I've built up over the years, things that I could have turned to a third-party tool like Keyboard Maestro, Alfred, or even my beloved Quicksilver for, but I like the simplicity of using a built-in application. </p>
<p>My "New Post" workflow is a simple example of using Automator to mix GUI elements with a shell script. There are only two actions. The first uses the "Ask for Text" action to prompt for a post title, and the second uses the "Run Shell Script" action to run this bit of bash: </p>
<pre><code>NAME=`echo $* | sed s/\ /_/g`
POSTNAME=`date "+%Y-%m-%d"-$NAME`
POST_FQN=~/Public/Site/_posts/$POSTNAME.markdown
POST_DATE=`date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`
touch $POST_FQN

echo "---" &gt;&gt;$POST_FQN
echo "title: $*" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "date: $POST_DATE" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "tags: " &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "---" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN


/usr/bin/open $POST_FQN
</code></pre>
<p>The first line removes spaces from the title passed to it from the Ask for Text action and replaces them with underscores so I can use the title as the URL slug. The second line adds the creation date[^1] to the file name, and the third creates a full path to the file. The fourth line simply creates an empty file with the correct naming scheme for my site generator tool. </p>
<p>The collection of <code>echo</code> statements on the next few lines add YAML frontmatter to the post, a bit of residual formatting from the sites Jekyll roots. Finally, I use the Mac's <code>open</code> command to start my favorite text editor, normally MacVim, and start writing. </p>
<p>Using Automator can be frustrating at times, especially when there is no action for something you think there should be an action for, but for manipulating text and mixing in scripting, it's not bad.  </p>
<p>[^1]: With apologies to Matt Gemmell. I've not yet committed to removing the ugly cruft from my URLs.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-07-17-A_Runner.html'>A Runner</a></h2>
<p>My workout this morning called for five miles. Run two, walk one, run the last two. I think in the Fall or Spring it would have been fairly easy, but today, in the July heat and humidity, every step felt like dragging a pair of anchors. My muscles gave out sooner, my breath ran out faster… it was a hard workout. I finished it though, because what I've learned is that even when it's hard, even when you are having a tough time and not going as fast as you'd like, you always have to finish. </p>
<p>I never imagined myself as a runner. I certainly don't look like one. Before I started this friends of mine would talk about running marathons and half-marathons I'd look at them in wonder and think how <em>I'd</em> never be able to do something like that. Now I've run two 5ks, one 10k, and I'm scheduled to run another 5 and another 10 in the next few weeks. I get up at five almost every morning during the week and run, and normally have another long run on Saturday. I think after a few years of this I'm finally comfortable enough to say I've become a runner. Today, even though I'm not ready to say I'm training for a marathon, the possibility is there, for the first time in my life.  </p>
<p>I'm not sure this would have happened without my iPhone. Every morning I strap it on my arm, launch the <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/running/nikeplus/gps-app">Nike+</a> app, start a podcast in <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> in the background, and start the day. Before I used Nike+ I used the excellent <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/couch-to-5k/id448474423?mt=8">Couch to 5k</a> app, which gently took me through getting off my lazy butt and pounding the pavement. The most important thing I took away from that app was the routine. Once I ran the 5k I didn't want to stop, so I switched to another app and a longer goal and kept going. </p>
<p>Running is my time. It's what I do for myself, it's how I make sure that the day is started right. It's how I can put my busy mind to rest. It's how I can balance staring into a computer screen all day solving puzzles with my concept of who I am and who I should be. Running is hard, running hurts, running is difficult and uncomfortable, running is calming, running is meditation. </p>
<p>I run in the heat and humidity. I run in the rain. I run in the freezing, bitter cold of winter. I run in the dark. I run before daybreak and I watch the sunrise over a pond along my route. I run with my dog. I run alone. I run in new shoes that give me blisters on my heels. I run when it hurts. I run when the weather is crisp and cool, and I've got all the energy in the world, and my legs forget their burden and carry me for miles and I feel like I could run around the world. </p>
<p>I'm a runner.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-06-28-on-computing.html'>On Computing</a></h2>
<p>I often daydream about <em>not</em> caring about my computer, and being able to go blissfully through my life with little concern about the mix of applications, storage of data, and how I interact with the machine, but that’s just a dream. The truth is I do care. I care a lot. I care enough that I’ve developed my own personal philosophy of computer use. I use this to determine which services and applications I will most likely be happy with. It helps me, maybe it will help you too.  </p>
<p>My computing philosophy rests on four pillars: security &amp; privacy, long term data storage and retrieval, simplicity, and power. I value these traits in a computing platform because of the amount of information my computer stores for me, and how much I rely on it for my research and work. I’ve been lucky enough, and privileged enough, to be able to turn my obsession with technology into a career, so my livelihood depends on me knowing how these things work, why they do the things they do, and keeping up to date on current trends and happenings in the field. I care because I have to, but also because not everyone understands the effect the choices they make with the technology they use have on their future selves. I’d like to not care, but I look at computers, applications, and the things we keep and I can’t help but see how things could go wrong. I care because I am compelled to. </p>
<p>This brings me to the four pillars. </p>
<p><strong>Security &amp; Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Maybe I’m getting old, but I believe that I shouldn’t have to give up personal information in exchange for using my computer. I should be able to protect my data as I see fit. I shouldn’t have to worry about security because my computing decisions and platform of choice ship with good, sensible defaults, and easy ways to enhance the default choice.  </p>
<p>So, I choose to use a Mac running OS X. I encrypt the hard drive using File Vault, and turn on the firewall to “Stealth Mode”. I use Safari for my primary browser, and I don’t install Flash. I’m not storing anything particularly interesting to anyone, just things that are important to me. A scan of our marriage certificate, all of our social security cards, bank statements going back many years, our birth certificates, details about various health related issues. Things that I don’t believe are the business of anyone else. </p>
<p>For more detailed reasoning on why we should all use encryption, see <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/06/why_we_encrypt.html">this article</a> by Bruce Schneier, excerpt below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is important. If we only use encryption when we're working with important data, then encryption signals that data's importance. If only dissidents use encryption in a country, that country's authorities have an easy way of identifying them. But if everyone uses it all of the time, encryption ceases to be a signal. No one can distinguish simple chatting from deeply private conversation. The government can't tell the dissidents from the rest of the population. Every time you use encryption, you're protecting someone who needs to use it to stay alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Long Term Data Storage and Retrieval</strong></p>
<p>Paper has a heck of a shelf life. If kept in reasonable conditions, a piece of paper will long outlive all of us. Unfortunately, as the volume of information you keep increases, so does the storage requirements, and if you are storing <em>everything</em> on paper, you are eventually going to need entire rooms filled with filing cabinets to keep your personal data library. It’s simply not a scalable solution in the digital age. </p>
<p>So, I store nearly everything of interest on the computer. Appliance manuals, copies of bills, academic papers, clippings from web pages, and of course, my own creative work. Since I’m storing the data on the computer, the computer needs to be configured in such a way as to enable retrieval ten, fifteen, twenty, or even fifty years from now. </p>
<p>To ensure the availability of my data in the future, I tend to use open formats whenever possible. I use plain text instead of Microsoft Word documents. I print complex documents to PDF. I do use some applications where I store data in a proprietary format as an intermediary step, but when the document is complete and I’m storing for future reference it is exported to either plain text or PDF. Any system that either cannot do this, or makes exporting of data to an open format complex or difficult is quickly discarded. </p>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>
<p>Even though I care about keeping my computer secure, and about making sure the things I write today will be accessible twenty years from now, doesn’t mean I want to spend hours upon hours tweaking my system. When I plug in my computer to an external display, I just want it to use that display, no mucking about. When I want to install a new application, I want that to be as straight-forward a process as possible. </p>
<p>I want the applications I use to behave in a consistent manner, and I want them to integrate deeply with the operating system. That way I don’t have to think about what key combination to press or how to accomplish a given task. When everything works as intended, the combination of applications all function in a similar way. I have one important exception to the simplicity rule, MacVim, but that is only because I’ve been using Vim for fifteen years and I know exactly how it works. However, in service to simplicity even this old stalwart servant may be removed from my machine soon. Plain text editors and writing tools have gotten very, very good in the past few years. </p>
<p><strong>Power</strong></p>
<p>There is absolutely no need to trade power for simplicity. In a mature, well designed system the two go hand in hand. Power is a general term that could mean many things depending on the context it is used in, even when speaking specifically about computers. The power I’m talking about here is the ability to handle complex, long-running tasks. To be able to keep up with the demands of a high-stress environment and to respond correctly when needed. The ability to run multiple, high-resource applications simultaneously without issue. </p>
<p>In my job I never know when things might need sudden and immediate attention, and I need my computer to <em>be there</em> for me when that happens. That means I don’t have time to recompile X.org or muck about with my network driver or worry about closing apps because I have too many of them open to deal with the issue at hand. I need my computer to be able to handle whatever might come around gracefully and without getting in my way. </p>
<p>Power is similar to flexibility, and incorporates certain attributes of a flexible system, but one that is more flexible than powerful will collapse under stress. A system that allows unlimited customization will not be able to adequately prepare for unexpected shifts in the demands placed on it. It’s easy to mistake one for the other, until the Director of Infrastructure is standing over your shoulder asking why this server just crashed and why it isn’t back up and running again yet. Then the difference becomes crystal clear. </p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>I’ve grown to use my machines in a certain manner, and expect them to behave in a certain way. I also expect that whatever system I’m using is going to respect my privacy, provide a substantial amount of security, and be powerful enough to do what I need it to do. These requirements may limit my choices, but they also provide focus and clarity on the technology I will allow into my life. </p>

<p>iPhones are expensive. Well, not just iPhones, all smart phones, Android, Windows, what have you. These little gadgets that we can walk out of a Verizon store with without paying a penny <em>now</em> wind up costing thousands <em>later</em>, once you consider the total cost of ownership. This is especially true if you are paying for an entire family, possibly one with two teenage daughters with phones of their own. </p>
<p>Our families phones are getting a bit long in the tooth, so I dropped by US Cellular to price out new ones and see what kind of deal I could get. Sometime in the past two years the phone companies have decided that the two year contract and reduced price for new phones is no good, and that the proper way to sell phones is with a twenty-month, no interest rate loan on the full price of the phone. Here’s how it breaks down.</p>
<p><strong>The Cost</strong></p>
<p>Assuming my wife and I purchased two middle of the road, 64GB iPhone 6’s, and bought two iPhone 5s’s for the kids under the new program, we’d be looking at $32.45 per month for mine, times two for my wife’s, which puts us at $64.90 per month. The girls’ phones are a little cheaper, coming in at $24.95 per month each, so $49.90 per month. </p>
<p>There’s a $60 fee for the 6GB per month data plan, shared between all the phones, and each phone would have a $20 per month “connection charge”. All together, that comes out to $254.80 per month. That number is still a little misleading though, because at this point we would have signed up for a 20 month loan. </p>
<p>At $254.80 per month for 20 months, the real two year price tag on the phones for our family is $5656.00. As desirable as these phones are, that’s a number that should give you pause while browsing through the store. If we kept that cycle up for ten years, the rough back of the napkin calculations put the cost at around <strong>$28,280.00</strong>. </p>
<p>It’s comforting to think that the price of the phone is worth it; you start thinking about the phone as a utility like gas or electric. A modern necessity you can’t get away from. That’s not true, it’s a lie you tell yourself to make the money you spend on these superfluous, magnificent devices palatable. We love our phones, but we are in uncharted territory now, not only are we spending thousands of dollars on them, we don’t fully understand how they are affecting our society, or ourselves. </p>
<p>But let’s put that concept to the side for the moment, and just concentrate on cost. Let’s say instead of the phones we bought a new iPad for each of us every year. At $300 per iPad Mini for the kids, and $600 per iPad Air 2 for my wife and I, we could buy a new iPad every year for each of us for $1800 per year, compared to $2828 per year for the phones. Of course, that’s not apples to apples, since you don’t buy a new iPhone every year, so the total annual cost for the iPads, replacing them every two years would be $900. </p>
<p>Of course, just having an iOS device doesn’t replace having a cell phone. Flip phones come cheap. You can get one at Verizon for $2.08 per month, and pay $5 per month for 700 minutes of talk time and unlimited texts. This plan still requires a $20 per phone access charge, so for our family the total month cost for flip phones would be $93.32 per month. Multiply that out for two years and it comes out to $2239.68. Ten years comes to $11,198.40. </p>
<p>So, we could, if we so choose, buy a new iPad every year, alternating between iPad Mini and a full sized iPad, and save around $400 every two years. Or, we could skip the iPads and just save $1400 every two years by trading our smart phones for dumb phones. The big question is if that’s worth it or not. </p>
<p><strong>The Benefit</strong></p>
<p>I use my iPhone every day, several times per day. It goes running with me first thing in the morning. I read the news with Unread at breakfast. I listen to Overcast on the drive to and from work. If my kids have a sporting event somewhere out of town, I use Apple Maps to get us there on time.[^1]. I chat with my friends and family throughout the day with Messages, and occasionally dip into <a href="http://twitterrific.com/ios">Twitteriffic</a> to catch up with the world. Occasionally I’ll open up <a href="https://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> at lunch and dive into a saved article. </p>
<p>I keep my world organized with <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/?utm_source=syndicate&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=mattgemmell-May2015">OmniFocus</a>, and make sure I’ve got all the important numbers[^3] I need with me at all times with <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a>. All of that could go away and I’d still be fine. What would bother me about going back to life without a smart phone would be the more personal interactions that I’d miss, or that simply wouldn’t happen. </p>
<p>My wife and I were on a date last night and I took a picture of her laughing that’s now my lock screen, and we took a couple of funny selfies to go along with it. Today my daughter sent me a beautiful, and long, text message that must have taken her some time to type up. Would I have either of these things if I didn’t have my smart phone, or if the rest of my family didn’t have theirs? Maybe. Maybe not. </p>
<p>My iPhone is my health coach, my newspaper, my camcorder, my camera, my music player, my talk radio[^2], my address book, my wallet, my journal, my temporary distraction, my reminder that right now, this instant, I’m living in a future I couldn’t have imagined when I was a teenager. Giving my family iPhones has meant that I’m there for my kids when they have a question, no matter where I actually am. It’s meant that we can trust them to go farther and stay later, knowing that checking up on them is just a tap away. It’s meant that we can stay on top of the things that are most important to us, and that we can stay connected, even when we are far apart. </p>
<p>It’s hard to put a price tag on that. </p>
<p>[^1]: I very, very rarely see a problem with Apple Maps, and when I do it’s minor enough that I don’t think much of it. 
[^2]: Podcasts. Not the crazy kind.
[^3]: Passcodes, door codes, insurance numbers, social security numbers, birth dates, etc…</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-04-16-Select_A_Column_of_Text_in_MacVim.html'>Select A Column of Text in MacVim</a></h2>
<p>I often need to work with columns of text; output from commands, text grabbed from a web page, what have you. Since I have a somewhat odd aversion to using a spreadsheet like a normal person, I discovered, nearly by accident, that I could easily select a column of text in <a href="https://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim.</a> </p>
<p>To do so, simply position the cursor where you would like to start, hold down option while dragging over the text you'd like to select. Once the text is selected, you can delete it, yank it, or insert new text for every row selected. </p>
<p>For an example, today I needed to comment out a few lines of text in a config file. Just for kicks I selected the first two characters of every row, pressed shift "i" (a capital i), typed the hash symbol, and when I pressed escape every row of text I had selected was commented out. </p>
<p>That example is a bit contrived, what I mainly use this for is just deleting columns to pair down the text I'm working with. Give it a try for yourself. I'm sure there's a way to do this without using the trackpad, but this is quick and easy enough for me to remember.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-04-15-Goodbye_to_The_Annual_Review.html'>Goodbye to The Annual Review</a></h2>
<p>John Siracusa hung up his cape today, <a href="http://hypercritical.co/2015/04/15/os-x-reviewed">announcing on his blog</a> that he would no longer be reviewing OS X. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nearly 15 years ago, I wrote my first review of Mac OS X for a nascent “PC enthusiast’s" website called Ars Technica. Nearly 15 years later, I wrote my last. Though Apple will presumably announce the next major version of OS X at WWDC this coming June, I won’t be reviewing it for Ars Technica or any other publication, including the website you’re reading now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a bittersweet moment for those of us who have been following John for over a decade, but it's well deserved, and the volume of work that he's left is a wonderful gift to the community. </p>
<p>John's explanation of Spotlight in the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2005/04/macosx-10-4/9/">OS X 10.4 review</a> was fundamental in my understanding of OS X as not just another Unix system. OS X is something different, something more. I remember this part in particular blowing my mind: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any file i/o that goes through the Tiger kernel will trigger the appropriate metadata importer. This kernel-level integration ensures that the Spotlight indexes are always up to date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read the whole thing, actually, start at the beginning and read every review from <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/1999/12/macos-x-dp2/">DP2</a>to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/10/os-x-10-10/">Yosemite</a>. His unapologetically deep dives into the details of OS X were something I and a lot of other geeks on the Internet looked forward to with each release. </p>
<p>Siracusa's reviews are required reading for anyone wanting a better understanding of how and why their Mac works the way that it does. I'm looking forward to the published, hardcover book, if it ever comes.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-04-14-Research_Kit_and_the_GPL.html'>Research Kit and the GPL</a></h2>
<p>Apple released ResearchKit as an open source project on <a href="https://github.com/ResearchKit/ResearchKit">GitHub</a> today. The project is complete with pull requests, a wiki, and a few sample projects to get started. While the project is great in its own right, it was the context of this tweet by Daniel Jalkut that caught my eye:</p>
<div class="bbpBox" id="t588033049943810049">

</div>

<p>Apple could have kept this to themselves, simply added ResearchKit along with AppKit and UIKit as another capability easily programmed into one of their platforms, but they didn't. That's not to say that Apple doesn't have selfish motivations with ResearchKit. Putting the iPhone at the center of medical research at a time when the healthcare industry is just starting to feel the weight of the baby boomers is clearly a strategic move for Apple, but I'm not sure that's <em>entirely</em> why they did it. Call me an idealist, but I think Apple created and released ResearchKit for the greater good. Which, finally, brings me to the license. </p>
<p>The license that they chose, the BSD license, permits the most "free" use of the code. If someone wants to port the code to Android, close it off, and sell it, they are perfectly free to do so, and Apple might even be ok with that. I think the spirit of what Daniel was saying is that, despite the ethical arguments on the side of the GPL, Apple is going to <em>actually</em> do more good for society with the combination of their devices and this liberally licensed  open source code. </p>
<p>I've made similar arguments before. The GNU community far too often overlooks actual utility in pursuit of a utopian dream. But, trust is a complicated subject, and trust and control are at the heart of what the GNU project is fighting for. They believe that if you do not have access to the source code of an application or device, that opens you up to being manipulated, spied on, or otherwise harassed. The license is designed to prevent anyone from taking a GPL licensed code base and closing it to public access. They are correct, to a point. However, the same people who make that argument are more often than not consumers of free online services like Gmail and Google Docs.</p>
<p>The proponents of the GPL like to define different levels and explanations of "freedom".  Free as in beer, free as in speech, and so on. Apple released code today that is designed to make the world a better place, and left it on the table for anyone to do whatever they wish with it. Study it, change it, use it as the base for your next hit app, whatever you like. That is real freedom, all around.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-04-13-The_Invisible_MacBook.html'>The Invisible MacBook</a></h2>
<p>A thread of minimalism weaves through Apple's products, starting with the Bondi blue iMac and flowing to the Apple Watch. One could argue that the minimal thread weaves back to the original Macintosh, a single, all-in-one device that made computing accessible, but I think the theme is most visible when looking at the modern age of Apple. Jony Ive's designs have consistently focused on aesthetically pleasing, usable design. A concept that simultaneously puts the device at the center of our day, and almost makes it disappear.  Technology is best when it is nearly invisible. The Apple Watch may be the culmination of this invisible tech, but it's the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/">new MacBook</a> that I believe embodies the design philosophy of Apple best. When the lid is closed on the new 12" Retina MacBook, it's so small and light that you hardly know it's there. </p>
<p>I spent a half hour or so with the new MacBook at our local Apple Store today. I walked away from the device with two conflicting feelings: 1. the space gray one is probably the most beautiful piece of computing hardware I've ever seen, and 2. I'll most likely not buy one.  Not yet anyway.</p>
<p><em>The Case</em></p>
<p>I have an allergic reaction to cables. At work I'm lucky enough to have a Thunderbolt display that handles and hides most of the cables from me, so that I only ever need to plug in two things to my MacBook Pro: power and the display. Thankfully, both are part of the same cable that comes from the display, but even this I'd rather not have. The new MacBook seems to <em>really get me</em>, it's simplified everything down to the absolute minimum of what's possible. </p>
<p>The retina screen is beautiful, and the case is just big enough to hold the keyboard. It's astonishing how small this computer really is. It's comparable to the 11" MacBook Air, but feels to be only a fraction of the bulk, and yet the MacBook retains the solid and sturdy construction we've come to expect in an Apple product. </p>
<p><em>The Trackpad</em></p>
<p>I was impressed with my first experience with the new Force Touch trackpad on the 13" MacBook Pro. I had a hard time believing at first that the glass was not actually moving, and like <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2015/4/the-new-trackpad">David Sparks</a> I was wondering if I was actually using the new trackpad or not. The trackpad on the MacBook felt almost the same, but there was something in the feel of the first click that felt <em>off</em> to me. It's not to say that there was anything wrong with how it functioned, and the second force click worked perfectly, just as before, but the MacBook's trackpad lost some of the magic of the one in the MacBook Pro. </p>
<p>It could be that I was surprised with how good it was in the Pro, and then expected it to be as surprising in the MacBook. It could also be that the particular models I tested were suffering from "demo version" syndrome, but I've rarely come across anything other than the best on display in an Apple Store. </p>
<p><em>The Keyboard</em></p>
<p>Apple made a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/design/">big production</a> out of their new keyboard design. The new butterfly key design provides a smoother, more consistent key press than the older scissor keys. As someone who types for a living, the keyboard is very important to me, and the feel of the keys makes a big difference. I've tried mechanical keyboards, ergonomic keyboards, and horrible PC keyboards, but I've always liked Apple's aluminum bluetooth keyboards the best. They have the same feel as the notebook keyboards, with just the right balance of resistance and feedback. I know when I'm pressing the right key on a standard Apple keyboard. </p>
<p>I didn't have the same experience with the MacBook keyboard. The keys are so close to the case that there is almost no travel when pressing down. The lack of travel makes it hard to tell if you've actually pressed the key, particularly when pressing one of the special keys like shift, option, or command. I typed out a few paragraphs in a few different apps on two display models, and repeatedly had issues not capitalizing a new sentence, or stopping to make sure I was hitting the right key. </p>
<p>It could be that the new keyboard will just take some getting used to. After all, the current line of keyboards was a change from the previous versions, but I think the current line is the best. I think if the MacBook keyboard stayed the same size, but increased tactile feedback when pressing a key, they'd have a winner. I didn't have any issues with the arrow keys (I never use them), but I did notice that the esc key was too close to the top left edge. Vim users might find that annoying, most everyone else probably won't. </p>
<p><em>Compromise</em> </p>
<p>The MacBook is certainly a compromised machine, but the deals it make are for the better. Smaller, lighter, more invisible. Stashed away when you don't need it, there for you immediately when you do, taking up so little space that you barely notice it. The MacBook might not be right for me now, but I'm going to give version two a very close look.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-03-23_force-touch-band.html'>Force Touch Band</a></h2>
<p>We took a trip to the mall the other day, and I took that chance to check out the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook/design/">Force Touch trackpad</a> on the MacBook Pro. Force Touch is an incredible feat of engineering, I couldn't stop thinking about <em>how</em> it was working. If I didn't know better, I'd assume that Apple just made a few minor enhancements to the trackpad to produce the different click. I really couldn't tell there was no depression of the glass; the illusion is phenomenally good. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the Force Touch trackpad, force sensors detect your click anywhere on the surface and move the trackpad laterally toward you, although the feel is the same familiar downward motion you’re accustomed to in a trackpad. The Taptic Engine also provides haptic feedback, so instead of just seeing what’s happening on the screen, you can feel it, too. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was surprised to find out that there were two levels of force that could be applied to the trackpad for different results. For example, if you hover over a word, and press down, and then keep going down to a secondary click, OS X will pop up the word definition. Likewise, if you do it on a date, OS X will open up a calendar. This demo gave me a new appreciation for how interacting with the Apple Watch will turn out, but it also made me excited for the next generation of iPhones. Assuming this technology spreads to all of Apple's products, I image an entire new level of user interaction design for iOS apps. There are interesting times ahead. </p>
<p>We left the Apple store and were detoured by a trio of XBoxs in a Microsoft pop-up store. While my boys were testing out the consoles, I wandered around the counters examining what Microsoft considers the best of breed. A flyer caught my eye that advertised a five dollar Starbucks giftcard if I demoed the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us">Microsoft Band</a>. Feeling a bit tired from the mall, I thought a jolt of caffeine would do me good, so I grabbed the flyer and asked the kid behind the counter for a demo. </p>
<p>First, they were out of Starbucks gift cards. But, since I was committed by this point, I tried on several of the bands till I found one that fit, and tried to keep up with the demo. I took three things away from my brief time with the Band:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This thing is bulky and uncomfortable. The top part of the Band, where the touch screen lives, is about an inch and a half rectangle of metal and glass surrounded by rubber. It did not even try to fit to the contours of my wrist. The clasp under my wrist was equally as uncomfortable. The kid advised that it needed to be snug for the laser to be able to read my pulse, which leads me to the second point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interface is confusing. I tried to get the Band to read my pulse, and when it didn't pick it up right away the kid tried to show me a few other things the band could do. Once I was away from the screen reading my pulse, I couldn't figure out how to get back to it again. The kid showed me how you could check your email, send text messages, and a few other unmemorable capabilities, and then he showed me the kicker. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has a keyboard. Seriously. I could clearly make out the letters "QWERTY" across the top row. The kid even typed something out on it. The presence of a software keyboard on a device that I'm supposed to wear on my wrist all day, and sleep with it all night, shows a significant lack of understanding at Microsoft of how people will actually interact with the device. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Microsoft is doing interesting things as they reinvent themselves, but I was just as much unimpressed with their Band as I was impressed by the Force Touch trackpad. The trackpad worked seamlessly and invisibly. The Band was uncomfortable and confusing. After demoing the Band, I paid for my own coffee.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-03-12-The_New_MacBook.html'>The New MacBook</a></h2>
<p>The tech world is once again loosing their grip after Apple has gone, as they see it, too far, too fast with the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook/">MacBook</a>. They can think of a thousand reasons why the Mac’s single USB-C port is a deal-breaker for any sane person. The single port is too restrictive. What if I want to hook up a USB mouse while I'm charging? Why isn't there a removable battery? Why can't I expand the storage? Less space than a Nomad. Lame. </p>
<p>The thing to keep in mind about the new Mac is the lack of a "Pro" moniker at the end of the name. The distinction between the MacBook and the MacBook Pro is the difference between a person who needs to hook up their Mac to two or three displays and one who needs a computer to write emails and read Buzzfeed. It's the difference between someone who takes the time to research and understand exactly what "USB-C" means, and someone who chooses to see the machine as a tool that allows them to do things that have nothing to do with computers. </p>
<p>It would be easy to assume that this is not a computer for geeks. </p>
<p>But it <em>can</em> be. Perhaps the more accurate description is that this computer is not for <em>gadget</em> geeks.  Leonardo da Vinci is quoted as saying "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." Apple pursues both simplicity and sophistication in all their products, pushing the public and the industry to abandon awkward technologies before they are comfortable. The floppy disk, the CD-ROM drive, and now all ports but one. Apple understands that technology is at it's best when it is virtually invisible. When it can integrate deeply and easily into our everyday lives without asking us to make accommodations for it. I'm a Unix geek, and I can tell you that as long as this Mac runs OS X, it can absolutely be a computer for geeks. </p>
<p>It can also be a computer for postage stamp collectors, and bird watchers, and students, and people into following celebrities, and sports fans, home brewers, dog lovers, cat lovers, athletes... in general, people. This may not be the right machine for you if you want to connect it to your USB keyboard, hard drive,  printer, and scanner all at once. Not that that's wrong in any way, it's just that this particular Mac is not the right tool for the job. Simply because the MacBook isn't the right tool for <em>this</em> job though is not going to stop it from selling in the millions. </p>
<p>There are a few reasons you might not want to buy this generation MacBook though. It is less powerful and more expensive than a MacBook Air, although that is offset by the Retina display. The new trackpad has no moving parts, and I'm a bit skeptical of how it will feel and perform over long periods of use, at least in the first generation. Subsequent generations of this machine, in this form factor are going to get better, and most likely less expensive. I expect in a few years for this Mac to start at $999.</p>
<p>Apple is moving in new directions, so I'm glad they are still doing interesting things with the Mac. The new MacBook is a beautiful piece of hardware, and an impressive technical accomplishment. On those merits, I expect it will do well.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-02-25-reading.html'>Reading at Night</a></h2>
<p>A couple years ago I started reading classic books to my boys before bedtime. We started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</a>, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a>, followed unsuccessfully by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea">Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</a> [^1]. Next, we read one of my all time favorite books, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Island">Treasure Island</a>, the classic pirate story from which nearly all other tellings of pirates are cribbed. We might go back and read that one again someday. </p>
<p>We just finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_of_the_Wild,">The Call of the Wild</a> and decided to follow it up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Fang">White Fang</a>. Jack London was a brilliant writer; he brings his audience with him to the harsh northern lands, where the law of club and fang is the only law. I'm looking forward to White Fang. So far we've only read the first chapter, but it starts out strong with two men, pursued by wolves, are returning the body of a third man from the snowy wilderness with a sled and six dogs. </p>
<p>Besides the books I read with the kids, I have a few <em>in progress</em> of my own. I'm reading through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maze_Runner">The Maze Runner</a>, mainly so I can talk it over with my younger daughter. I'm also reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_Riders">The Rough Riders</a>, the story of Theodore Roosevelt's time in the calvary during the Spanish-American War. Next on the list is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hateship,_Friendship,_Courtship,_Loveship,_Marriage">Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage</a> by Alice Munro. I picked this one up at the Half Price Bookstore because Munro's name is on a list of books, and the back cover looked interesting enough.</p>
<p>I also have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel)">The Martian</a> by Andy Weir, based on recommendation by <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/187/">The Incomparable</a>. Finally, I plan on finishing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick">Moby Dick</a> before summer, the Herman Melville classic that's been on my mind to read for years. After finishing the four other books on my plate, I'm going to give that one my full attention. </p>
<p>I'm always looking for new book recommendations. I just add them to the list as they come in. I don't expect I'll ever actually finish the list, it seems to grow faster than I can read, which is exactly what I want. I imagine myself as an old man someday, surrounded by books.

</article><article><h2><a href='2015-01-16-The_Long_View.html'>The Long View</a></h2>
<p>Computers as tools for creation are unique in that they change and evolve over time as software is updated. A hammer that you buy today can reasonably be expected to perform the same in twenty years, assuming that the tool is taken care of properly. Similarly, the bench that you build with the hammer will still be good to sit on, no matter what happens to the hammer that built it. Not so with computers and software. Not only do the tools used to create change over time and perform in sometimes unexpected ways, the artifacts of our creation are often subject to artificial limitation on use. How ridiculous would it be for a bench to only be able to be sat in if you were holding the hammer you used to build it? And yet, this is the arrangement we agree to with our software more often than not. </p>
<p>Creating documents with Word or Pages, storing precious family photographs in iPhoto, or locking your research away in OneNote or Evernote are all examples of a short-sighted view of technology. They work well for the near term, but taking the long view of technology requires a consideration of the nature of the format your data is stored in. </p>
<p>The amount one should care about the format their data is stored in and their access to their data is in direct proportion to how much one <em>cares</em> about the data. Proprietary file formats  come with a built-in expiration date; unlike a gallon of milk though, you don't get to know when your software's expiration date is. Sooner or later, whoever controls that format will update it, and eventually leave your important data irretrievable. Are you sure you'll be able to open that Pages document in twenty years? You may not be able to <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5752537">open a Pages document</a> from three years ago. </p>
<p>Some of this argument may sound familiar to the open source community. Control and longevity of personal computing systems is at the heart of much of what open source stands for. What open source enthusiasts often miss is that the method of manipulating the data matters far less in the long run than ensuring that your data remains in a format that makes the best effort to be accessible in twenty, thirty, or a hundred years from now. That means not locking your important data in proprietary formats that may go by the wayside, but it also means using the best tools for the job at hand. </p>
<p>Using commercial software is perfectly acceptable as long as the tools either offer export of your data to an open format, or work directly with the open format[^1]. For writing, I prefer plain text, HTML, and PDF. Occasionally, I may revert back to LaTeX if necessary to create a complicated document intended to be printed, but the need for that is less and less as time goes on. My files are organized in a filesystem, using logical file names and a simple folder hierarchy. </p>
<p>No company is guaranteed to be around forever. Nor are they guaranteed to always keep your best interests at heart. However, as long as there is a way to easily export your data to an open format, it makes sense to use the best tools available. In my opinion, the best computer on the market is a MacBook Pro, and the best operating system is OS X. OS X offers the best combination of usability, aesthetics, and power of any system currently available. </p>
<p>Much of my opinion on this matter comes from my own experience. Much of it was influenced by the writings of Dr. Drang and his series on text files, as well as Seth Brown and David Sparks. If you'd like to read more from people that have been bitten by proprietary formats and/or poor organizational methods, here's a weekends reading list.   </p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2015-01-05-The_Best_of_Whats_Around.html'>The Best of What's Around</a></h2>
<p>Marco struck a nerve with his <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-ground">latest post</a> lamenting the declining quality of Apple software. The post was picked up by "analysts" and debated on television by a panel of "experts". While I understand the frustrations of those affected by more serious bugs than I've seen, I can't help but wonder if they really understand what the alternatives are like. </p>
<p>This whole débâcle reminded me of 2006 when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060613074151/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks,">Mark Pilgrim</a>, <a href="http://boingboing.net/2006/06/29/mark-pilgrims-list-o.html">Cory Doctoro</a>, and <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/15/Switch-From-Mac">Tim Brey</a> left the Mac for Linux. Some of the same reasons were cited then, although for these three I think the openness of Linux meant more than software quality. But, as <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/2015/01/05/the-functional-high-ground/">Daniel Jalkut pointed out</a>, Apple's software has always had bugs, and people have always been upset about it. It's easy to look at the past through rose-colored glasses, but the truth is that there were some pretty terrible releases in the past.  </p>
<p>We do seem to be at a low point in the ebb and flow of Cupertino software. I use Mail, Safari, Calendar, and iTunes daily, and from time to time I see bugs here and there. My personal pet peeve is that the Dock no longer automatically minimizes when I move a window to full screen mode. Instead, it just obstructs the bottom part of the window. An annoyance, to be sure, but it's not the end of the world. </p>
<p>Overall Yosemite has been a fantastic release for me. I enjoy the new aesthetic, although I think the transparency could be toned down a bit, and the apps I use daily work great. I haven't had the kind of problem that forces a reboot once a week, or to see iTunes crash once a day. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, clearly it does, and I'm just one data point, but I just don't see it. </p>
<p>Apple's apps aren't what make the platform great anyway. What makes the Apple ecosystem a great place to work and play is the abundance of very high quality third party apps. <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a>, <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html">DEVONthink</a>, <a href="http://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a>, <a href="http://acqualia.com/soulver/">Soulver</a>, <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/10-14-2013/Quicksilver.html">Quicksilver</a>, <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a>, <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a>, the list goes on. It was Apple's platform and, more importantly, their <em>taste</em>, which encouraged the developers to build their absolute best. No other platform has this. I know, I've looked. </p>
<p>Linux is a mess from top to bottom. Windows is a hollow corporate shell trying to be relevant again. FreeBSD? Not a chance. Yes, it's important to point out the flaws in the Mac and iOS platforms, and yes it's good to remind Apple to stay on the path of light, but before we all decide to download the latest Ubuntu iso, let's also take a moment to appreciate how fantastic these machines and their software really are. In comparison, nothing else even comes close. </p>
<p>PS. Apple, fix your bugs. Seriously, some of this is just embarrassing.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-01-04-Adopting_BBEdit_Scripts_in_Vim.html'>Adopting BBEdit Scripts for Vim</a></h2>
<p>In addition to my experiments with the design of this site, I was also testing out BBEdit as my main writing and programming tool. BBEdit didn't stick, but I did like some of the scripting the good <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/11/markdown-table-scripts-for-bbedit/">Dr. Drang</a> has done, and wanted to adopt a few for MacVim. I started with three of his scripts today, one to paste and select text in one command, one to convert a tab-separated table to Markdown, and another to even up the Markdown table so it's easier to read in plain text. </p>
<p>Since Dr. Drang's scripts read from stdin and output to stdout[^fn1], converting them to Vim was very easy, once I found the right syntax for my vimrc file[^fn2]. My first thought was that I would be able to copy the same syntax I use for calling the outstanding <a href="http://drbunsen.github.io/formd/">formd by Seth Brown</a>, but formd is meant to parse the entire text of the file, not just the selection. Eventually, I found my answer on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2575545/vim-pipe-selected-text-to-shell-cmd-and-receive-output-on-vim-info-command-line">StackOverflow</a>.</p>
<p>My vimrc file now has the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>" Even up a markdown table
vmap &lt;leader&gt;mn &lt;esc&gt;:'&lt;,'&gt;!~/Unix/bin/Normalize-Tables.py&lt;CR&gt;

" Convert a tab separated tabel to a markdown table
vmap &lt;leader&gt;mt &lt;esc&gt;:'&lt;,'&gt;!~/Unix/bin/Tabs-to-Markdown-Tables.pl&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The first word, <code>vmap</code>, maps the shortcut to visual selections in Vim. Next, <code>&lt;leader&gt;mn</code> creates the shortcuts <code>,mn</code> for <em>Normalize-Tables.py</em> and <code>,mt</code> for <em>Tabs-to-Markdown-Tables.pl</em>. </p>
<p>The next part <code>&lt;esc&gt;:'&lt;,'&gt;</code> grabs the selection and passes it to the command, which starts with an exclamation point[^fn3] and ends with <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code>, which stands for "Carriage Return".</p>
<p>I need to spend some time in my vimrc file to sort out the naming convention for all the key maps, but for now, I'm thinking ",mn" for "markdown normalize", and ",mt" for "markdown from tabs". </p>
<p>For the third part I'm borrowing from Dr. Drang, I wanted to paste and select text at the same time. Once again I had to turn to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4312664/is-there-a-vim-command-to-select-pasted-text?rq=1">StackOverflow</a>, and now have this mapped in vimrc: </p>
<pre><code>nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;sp :set paste&lt;CR&gt;:put  *&lt;CR&gt;:set nopaste&lt;CR&gt; &lt;Bar&gt; `[v`]
</code></pre>
<p>The first part sets the mapping, <code>,sp</code>, which I'm thinking of as "select paste", and then pastes the text from the OS X system clipboard. Next, the <code>&lt;Bar&gt;</code> entry strings two mappings together in Vim. Finally, <code>\</code>[v`]` performs the selection on the last change to the text. </p>
<p>So, now I can take text from Excel like this:</p>
<pre><code>Left align  Center align    Right align
This    This    This
column  column  column
will    will    will
be  be  be
left    center  right
aligned aligned aligned
</code></pre>
<p>paste and select it with <code>,sp</code>, followed by <code>,mt</code> to convert the table to Markdown.</p>
<pre><code>|Left align|Center align|Right align|
|--|--|--|
|This|This|This|
|column|column|column|
|will|will|will|
|be|be|be|
|left|center|right
|aligned|aligned|aligned|
</code></pre>
<p>and finally <code>,mn</code> to even the table up nicely:</p>
<pre><code>| Left align | Center align | Right align |
|:-----------|:------------|:-------------|
| This       | This        | This         |
| column     | column      | column       |
| will       | will        | will         |
| be         | be          | be           |
| left       | center      | right        |
| aligned    | aligned     | aligned      |
</code></pre>
<p>As always, my thanks to the good Doctor for scripts and inspiration. </p>
<p>[^fn1]: As God intended. 
[^fn2]: Someday, someone will create the perfect app for managing your vimrc file, but today is not that day.

</article><article><h2><a href='2015-01-03-All_Mine.html'>All Mine</a></h2>
<p>I've been experimenting with the design of this site for the past couple weeks. First, I used a default Jekyll template, slightly modified to my liking. Next, I tried out a very nice theme that made good use of hero images and included nice typography. I changed the name of the site to "INTERACT", and briefly considered leaving it at that. Unfortunately, the more I looked at the site the more it looked like it belonged to someone else. </p>
<p>Something reminded me of Merlin Mann and John Gruber's <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2009/03/25/blogs-turbocharged">South By Southwest</a> panel where John said he wanted to own every pixel of his site, from the top left to the bottom right. I agree. This little part of the Internet has my name on it, it's jonathanbuys.com, and I want to be able to point at this site and say "I built this". </p>
<p>It's not much, I'm not a web designer. I've tried to optimize the site to make it easy to read, and easy to port between hosting companies. I'm back to using my own Python script for generating the site, so there might be a few inconsistencies or characters that are missing or not rendered correctly. I'm going to work on that. </p>
<p>In the meantime, once again, I own every pixel of this site. From the top left, to the bottom right.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-01-02-Cellular-Options.html'>Cellular Options</a></h2>
<p>I pulled into the gas station on my way home after a long day, picked up my phone in my left hand, intending to put it in my pocket, and opened the door of my pickup. While pushing the door of the truck open, the phone slipped out of my hand and fell face down on the pavement, shattering the screen. </p>
<p>I’m not the type who can carry around a broken phone for months, so the next day I called <a href="http://www.uscellular.com">US Cellular</a> to see what my options were. I was one year into a two year contract, so the prospects of actually getting anything out of my carrier were grim. I was right. The support person on the phone said that since I didn’t opt into the US Cellular insurance program, I either have to look into having the phone fixed, or buy a new phone at full price. Turns out, there are several options. </p>
<p>Buying a new phone at full price is the most expensive up front, and the option where I received conflicting information from the support people. Since the only iPhone 5C carried by US Cellular is the 8GB model (which should be an embarrassment for them and Apple), I was looking to buy a 5S, or possibly a 6. The 5S retails for $549, and the 6 for $650, but when considering the benefits of paying for the phone up front I became confused. The phone is not of much use without the cellular contract to go with it, and US Cellular charges a $40 “connection fee” for each line attached to my $70 per month plan. My question to US Cellular was what is the benefit from buying my phone up front if I still have to pay the connection fee?</p>
<p>Faced with a $650 charge for a new phone, I pulled the ace from my sleeve and said the magic words: “I think I might cancel my account.” The cancellation fee is $350, which some carriers might pay for you, which would bring my out of pocket costs down to $200, or maybe $100 to get into a new phone. Albeit with a new carrier and a complicated situation with the rest of my family still on the old plan. I didn’t think it was a serious option, but mentioning the cancellation was enough to get me pushed through to another level of support, who was happy to move my upgrade eligibility up an entire year to keep me with the company. </p>
<p>So, now my options were a little better. I could buy a new phone at full price, buy a new phone at the discounted rate, I could finance the full price of the phone over two years (which is a new option I wasn’t aware of before), or I could keep my phone and fix the screen. </p>
<p>The question remained though, why would I ever buy a new phone at full price? The source of my confusion centered around the $40 connection fee. One representative told me that the fee was there so the company could recoup the cost of the subsidized phone. If so, they are making a healthy profit off of each phone sold; $40 per month over two years comes out to $960. Another representative told me that no matter what, <em>if I owned my phone or if I bought it at a discounted price</em>, I had to pay the connection fee. The only way not to pay the fee was to finance the phone. </p>
<p>If I financed the phone for two years they would wave the fee, but in place of the fee I would be paying $32 per month on an interest free twenty month loan. Also, financing the phone would make me eligible to upgrade to a new line every eighteen months, if I was willing to pay the remainder of the phone off, or trade in the phone for a new model. This seemed interesting, but it also seemed like a way for me to remain in debt of one kind or another continuously. Even though the total paid out seemed to make more sense over time, financing did not appeal to me. </p>
<p>So, I decided, grudgingly, to buy a new phone at the discounted rate. I found the nearest US Cellular store, and went in to buy an iPhone 5S. While I was talking to the representative I asked her again about the connection fee. This was at least the third time I’d talked to someone at US Cellular about the fee, and this time the answer was different. If you own your phone, and you are not under contract, there is no connection fee. This changed things for me. If there was no fee for my phone that I had now, the best course of action I could take would be to fix the phone. I told her about my change in plans, and the conflicting information I’d gathered. To make her point she removed the fee from my account while I was sitting there. </p>
<p>I left the store without a new phone, went back to my desk, and ordered a $35 replacement screen and toolkit from Amazon. In two days the screen arrived, and I spent an hour and a half replacing it. Now my white iPhone 5C has a white face on it, and a black button, giving the phone some character. Also, I’m not under contract with US Cellular. I think for my next phone, whenever that happens to be, I’ll be paying full price for it, and staying out of contract lock-in from here on out.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2015-01-01-beginnings-2015.html'>The Million Monkeys</a></h2>
<p>Computers, the bicycles for the mind, the idea engines; when we work at a computer we open the door to limitless avenues of creativity. Cracking open the lid of a laptop can be the first step to writing a novel, starting a new career, or getting in touch with long lost friends. But, when the machines misbehave, when they don’t perform as expected or present their interface in ways that are difficult or impossible to decipher, even the most mundane of tasks become a chore. The possibilities for the future melt away under the perception that computers are difficult and unreliable, our untrustworthy opponent to getting things done.</p>
<p>I use a Mac because every time I need it <em>it works</em>, and it has a consistent interaction language. That is, the main tools all recognize a similar set of common keyboard and mouse commands. Cut, copy, paste, click &amp; drag, swipe to go back, etc… in a well designed environment each application operates nearly indistinguishably as part of the whole. The Mac is everything I wanted from a Linux or BSD desktop: all the power of Unix under the hood, and a well designed GUI on top of it. As great as I’ve always thought open source is, after waiting for  fifteen years I think it’s safe to say that the year of the Linux desktop is never going to happen. </p>
<p>I remember when I first learned about OS X and the FreeBSD underpinnings. I was overseas, stationed in England in the Navy. I spent my days building firewalls and web servers with OpenBSD, and my nights loading every version of Linux I could get my hands on into this beige IBM PC. I resolved that as soon as I got back to the states I’d get a Mac. At the time, desktop Linux was rough, I mean <em>really rough</em>. Most of the time the modem wouldn’t work, there was no broadband, some of the devices (like the sound card) would work, some wouldn’t. You might be able to get native resolution on your monitor, you might not. You could download and compile a new driver for your CD player to listen to music, but that might drop you into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency hell</a>. </p>
<p>Things have cleaned up quite a bit in the open source world since then. Package managers like <em>yum</em> and <em>apt</em> make installing applications a breeze, while automatically handing dependency issues. However, the overall quality of the systems still can’t compare to OS X in either application fit and finish, or in system reliability. I challenge anyone to come up with a desktop application that debuted first on the Linux desktop, I mean something that is truly original happening first on Linux. That’s simply not where the innovation in the field is happening.</p>
<p>I should stop for a moment to say that I believe open source takes two forms: consumer code and server. Server side open source has been advancing at a breakneck speed, pushed by major influx of talent and money by big companies like Google and Amazon, as well as entrepreneurs building on Linux to deploy their applications. The best tools for the server are being built for open source, the best software for the consumer is being built by independent Mac developers. </p>
<p>Years ago some thought that open source would eventually take over everything, we were always just <em>one release away</em> from Linux being great. After all, the open source desktop had thousands of developers all over the world, all donating their time and talent for free, because they believed in what they were doing. What has actually happened is that the Linux desktop has become just good enough for some limited day to day use in specific scenarios. Why haven’t the thousands of programmers been able to surpass OS X after all these years? Why isn’t the Mac playing catch up to PCs running Ubuntu, instead of <a href="http://elementaryos.org">the other way around?</a></p>
<p>Part of it has to do with how Apple controls both the hardware and the software of their systems. Part of it has to do with how Apple has been able to pay good wages to talented developers for a very long time. Part of it has to do with the hierarchy of designers within the company, all working towards a common goal and an overarching theme. Linux has thousands of developers, but it doesn’t have a single unified vision for what the system should be. Instead, they have massively distributed groups, each working individually on their own component, each defining how their part should work. </p>
<p>Linux has talented developers, and <a href="http://design.ubuntu.com">pockets of designers</a>, but until they are all under one roof they won’t be able to compete with Apple. Apple has nearly 40 years of experience developing personal computers, that’s tough to compete with for anyone. </p>
<p>As for Linux? A million monkeys typing endlessly may someday create the entire works of Shakespeare, but in the meantime, they are going to write a lot of junk. </p>

<p>My commute takes me past the <em>sanitary landfill</em> every morning, a daily reminder to be careful about what I throw away, and what I can recycle. Driving by the dump doesn't bother me per se, but the maniacs who drive the dump trucks do. I've learned to watch the turn into the dump, watching for the massive metal beasts, trying to anticipate when they'll pull out, and if I'll have to swerve out of their way. </p>
<p>They take left turns towards Des Moines, swinging out into the fast lane of 163 and hitting the gas. <em>So far</em> they haven't hit me, but any time someone pulls into the road in the adjacent lane I get nervous. They appear too quickly, not yet with the flow of the traffic, a towering green structure of steel on wheels tilting slightly towards the top from the force of the turn. The dump trucks accelerate quickly, first matching my speed, then passing it. They're in a hurry, they've got a job to do. </p>
<p>I get out of their way.</p>
<p>This morning one passed me on the bypass; I was going seventy. </p>
<p>It's hard to be critical of someone doing their job, doubly so when their job is driving a dump truck. It's not exactly the most desirable job in the world, although I understand they are well compensated. The trucks take me out of my own little world and remind me of our human bravery. Every day I spend hours hurtling down asphalt in my own steel beast, one mistake away from certain death. It happens every day; the sign on 235 says over three hundred people have died on the roads in Des Moines this year. We never think it could happen to us, until it does. I never think it could happen to me, until a green dump truck swings into the road unexpectedly and scares me half to death.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-12-02-things-that-dont-belong-in-browsers.html'>Things That Dont Belong in Browsers</a></h2>
<p>I still have a soft spot in my heart for Firefox, but it’s not my primary browser. I use Safari for just about everything, except the rare occasion when I <em>need</em> flash, then I use Chrome. Firefox is only used in the even rarer occasion that I need to use a site that Safari doesn’t support properly. Since I use all three browsers, I keep an eye on new features and development, wondering if something new from Firefox will draw me away from Safari. </p>
<p>I don’t think it’s going to happen.</p>
<p>Firefox released version 34 yesterday, which included a handful of fixes and improvements, but also included these two new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>New - Firefox Hello real-time communication client</li>
<li>Developer - WebIDE: Create, edit, and test a new Web application from your browser</li>

<p>This isn't the first time a Mozilla browser included a "real-time communications client" as part of the browser. Feature blot that leads to including features that would be better suited as separate applications is one of the reasons Firefox was initially split from the Mozilla browser to begin with, as this quote from the <a href="http://website-archive.mozilla.org/www.mozilla.org/firefox_releasenotes/en-US/firefox/releases/0.1.html">release notes of Phoenix 0.1</a> highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third, "Mozilla" is not the name of an application; it is the name of a monolithic suite containing a browser, a mail client, an irc client, and an indoor skating rink (we hear that's coming, anyways.) Even if we did decide to call this browser Mozilla, we'd still have to call the standalone mail client (see below) something else. We also believe Mozilla, in general, is going in the wrong direction in terms of bloat and UI, and see no reason for our releases to carry those connotations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To come full circle, Firefox now includes a browser, a video chat client, and an integrated development environment in addition to the indoor skating rink. Firefox was amazing because it was <em>super</em> fast, and it attributed much of that speed to being very focused on the browsing experience. Mozilla has seen fit to morph Firefox over the years into a platform, one that is ill suited for most users everyday needs. </p>
<p>The tools and <em>features</em> that Mozilla builds into Firefox are high quality, especially the developer tools, but they would benefit far more from being separate applications.</p>

<p>It appears I’ll be getting a new Mac soon, which means it’s time to take inventory of what I need. I’ve written about this a <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/2008/11/04/essentials.html">couple</a> of <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/2012/07/19/New_Mac_Essentials.html">times</a> before, and it’s interesting to look back and see what apps stick, and which have gone by the wayside. </p>
<p>Obviously, I’m still using OS X, and I’m still using most of the built in apps like Safari, Mail, Calendar, Contacts, and so on. I still backup with Time Machine, although I’ve added a secondary, off-site back up with <a href="https://www.backblaze.com">Backblaze</a>. </p>
<p><em>Apps from 2008 I stopped using:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Adium - Work forced me to move to Lync, which is terrible, slow, and bloated, but at least it crashes every now and then. </li>
<li>Shimo - The built in VPN client in OS X is so good I don’t need Shimo anymore. </li>
<li>Google Calendar - I don’t use Google anything anymore. </li>
<li>MarsEdit - I’ve got a lot of respect and admiration for Daniel Jalkut over at <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com">Red Sweater</a>, but I manage this blog with Jekyll, and do all of my writing in MacVim. I think at one point I just didn’t upgrade my license.  </li>
<li>TextMate - I mentioned in the old post that I couldn’t get my configuration working for vi. Well, that’s no longer an issue, and my MacVim setup works just fine. </li>
<li>Yojimbo - I wish I could say that I still used Yojimbo, and that Bare Bones came out with an iPhone client that synced seamlessly using iCloud. But, that didn’t happen, and Evernote ate Yojimbo’s lunch. Even when I obsess about file storage and personal information organization, I eventually realize that Evernote is the best choice for what I want, which is to not think about what I’m storing where. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Apps from 2012 I stopped using:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>NetNewsWire - I really, really wanted to believe that Black Pixel was going to do great things with NetNewsWire. I decided I didn’t want to wait anymore, and I’ve moved on. </li>
<li>DEVONthink - Call me when DEVONthink To Go 2.0 is out, and has sync that works.</li>
<li>Chrome - Used only when I absolutely, positively, have to use Flash.</li>
<li>Read Later - Beautiful app, but I moved on.</li>
<li>The Hit List - I finally drank the <a href="http://macsparky.com/omnifocus-screencasts/">MacSparky Kool-Aid</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, what I am using.</p>
<p><em>Essential Utilities</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://qsapp.com">Quicksilver</a> - <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/2013/10/14/Quicksilver.html">Still the best</a>. I’ve tried switching over to Spotlight full time, but there are too many features from Quicksilver that I miss. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> - Until iCloud Drive makes sense. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.lightheadsw.com/caffeine/">Caffeine</a> - So my Mac won’t fall asleep when I don’t want it to. </li>
<li><a href="http://manytricks.com/moom/">Moom</a> - Keyboard window management, this is a fantastic tool. </li>
<li><a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a> - For all your text expanding needs. I don’t use this nearly as much as I think I could, but I get enough out of it that I notice when it’s missing right away. Normally as soon as I go to name a file. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Library Applications</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> - I can’t imagine trying to keep over 400 strong, unique passwords without 1Password. </li>
<li><a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a> - Sometimes I go a <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/2014/10/27/Sensible_Information_Organization.html">little nuts</a> on information management. Evernote sits and waits patiently for me to get my wits about me and come back. </li>
<li><a href="http://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> - I’m an infrequent journaler, but the more I use Day One, the more I value this app. Looking back at the past year of entries is a great way to put a smile on my face. </li>
<li>Oh, and, um, iTunes, I guess.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Tools for Creation</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a> - Still the best tool for writing words and manipulating text. </li>
<li><a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a> - Recently upgraded to v2, Marked continues to earn its spot in my Dock, right next to MacVim.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a> - The best diagramming tool.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> - For keeping all the big and little things I need to do, and helping me know when to actually do them. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a> - I bought a copy of CS5 while in grad school, Photoshop is the only part that I’m probably going to keep using. Possibly Illustrator, depends on what the next year or so brings. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Spare Time</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://hibariapp.com/">Hibari</a> - Still my favorite Twitter app, although I’m not sure if I’ll be able to <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/11/24/twitter-california-knife.">keep using it for long</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://readkitapp.com">ReadKit</a> - ReadKit combined both Read Later and NetNewsWire, and although the reading experience is first rate, I miss the smooth keyboard navigation of NNW. However, ReadKit integrates with all the latest RSS services, and NetNewsWire does not. Like DEVONthink though, call me when you’ve got good sync to iOS. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the apps, I use a handful of command line tools from time to time, installed with Homebrew. I’m getting <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2014/03/08/New-Mac-Setup">too old not to</a>.</p>
<p>If my transition of apps that I use had a theme, it would be moving to systems where mobile is a priority. I’m no longer using Yojimbo or NetNewsWire, and to be honest, I’m a little disappointed in that fact.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-11-21-aws-reinvent.html'>AWS reInvent Conference</a></h2>
<p>The re:Invent conference was fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>Culture</strong></p>
<p>First, the overall experience of the conference was fantastic. There were, of course, a few hiccups along the way, that's going to happen anytime you put 13,000+ people in the same conference, but overall everyone I talked to was enthusiastic and positive about what Amazon is doing. The feel was energetic, and, importantly, <em>diverse</em>. </p>
<p>I met people from many different races and nationalities at the conference, and saw quite a few women attending as well. The men outnumbered the women, probably by 10:1 at least, but they were there, and that's important. I'd like to see that number getting closer to 1:1 as the years go by. </p>
<p>The conference had a Japanese track, where popular sessions were given again, this time speaking in English a bit slower, and live translation provided for a primarily Japanese speaking audience. The sessions were never very crowded, and I found that I could easily get a seat at the front. Of course, if I ever saw any Japanese waiting for a seat I would have given mine up, but there were lots of empty seats. </p>
<p>One of the most poorly designed aspects of the conference were that it didn't stagger the sessions out, so at the same time each hour, 13,000 people crowded the hallways and escalators, making it difficult to get from one session to the next. </p>
<p><strong>Scale</strong></p>
<p>The most interesting session I attended was held by James Hamilton, AWS VP and Distinguished Engineer (quite the title), titled “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIQETrFC_SQ">Innovation at Scale</a>”. James Hamilton has been part of the tech industry for <a href="http://www.mvdirona.com/jrh/Resume/">quite a while</a>. He was formerly at Microsoft, and IBM before that, and was the lead architect on DB2 when it was ported to Unix. This guy knew what he was talking about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the next decade in our industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I knew Amazon was big, but I didn’t realize just how big till I sat in on this session. Amazon S3 has grown by 132% in the past year, and EC2 over 99%. AWS has over five times the capacity in use than the aggregate total of the other fourteen providers in the industry. That includes Azure, Rackspace, IBM, Joyent, and all the rest.</p>
<p>Every day, AWS adds enough new server capacity to support all of Amazon’s global infrastructure when it was a $7B annual revenue enterprise, back in 2004. They are big, and growing fast.</p>
<p>AWS is split into eleven regions world-wide, and private AWS fiber interconnects all major regions. Inside each region are very high levels of redundancy. For example, in the US East region, there are 82,864 fiber strands connecting their availability zones and data centers. In each region, there are at least two Availability Zones (AZ). Latency between the AZs is less than 2ms, and normally less than 1ms.</p>
<p>Peak network traffic between AZs reaches 25Tbps, and yes, that’s <em>terabits</em> per second. All AZs are in different data centers. Capacity in an AZ is added by adding new data centers. Failover between data centers within an AZ is transparent. Each AWS data center holds between 50,000 and 80,000 servers. Inbound bandwidth to a single data center is up to 102Tbps. </p>
<p>Another interesting fact I learned is that Amazon has custom chips built only for them by Intel for their custom-built servers. The chips have a faster processor at a given core count than what is available to the public from this partnership because of the scale Amazon operates at.</p>
<p>Amazon also builds all of their own networking equipment. They found that it was a lot cheaper to build their own networking gear. Not only did the overall cost of the networking gear go down, but the availability went up. It turns out that building their own gear allowed them to specialize on solving only their problems, which is a much smaller set of problems than the entire worlds that commercial networking vendors have to solve for. Amazon spun up 8000 servers to test their networking gear before they went into production.</p>
<p>Amazon runs their own version of Linux, which originally started off life as a Red Hat clone, something like CentOS, but has subsequently been heavily modified for Amazon’s particular needs. For example, Amazon has built their own networking stack tuned for the volume of traffic they need to process.</p>
<p>A lot of the work on their hypervisor has been to eliminate the virtualization tax. In the latest system they are rolling out, the NIC in each server supports SR-IOV (Single-Root I/O Virtualization), and each VM gets it’s own hardware virtualized NIC. This results in much lower latency, and less latency jitter from the instances.</p>
<p><strong>Building the Future</strong></p>
<p>I'm not sure how long Amazon is going to own this space, but they are certainly not slowing down and waiting for their competitors to catch up. I'm more in favor of a distributed Internet than one modeled after the old mainframe, client-server approach, but the capabilities that Amazon gives other businesses can't be ignored. </p>
<p>My favorite analogy is the electric company. Any business that wanted to could build their own power generators and distribution infrastructure, but it would be crazy for them to do it. The economics just aren't there. It's far, <em>far</em> more affordable, and reliable, to let the specialists do it for you, and just pay for what you use. That's what AWS is building, computing on tap, just bring your code. </p>
<p>The times are changing; either keep up, or get out of the way. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-10-28-Open_Source_News_Design.html'>Open Source News Design</a></h2>
<p>Finding good design in open source can be hard, but it’s almost impossible to find in open source news sites. These sites take “reader hostile” to a new level. Take example “A”, Phoronix:</p>
<p><img src="/media/phoronix-ads.png" /></p>
<p>The advertisement completely obstructs the text. Once the ad is closed, which I’m assuming counts as a “click”, the site is not too terrible to read. Of course, it’s no Daring Fireball. </p>
<p>The problem is compounded when using an aggregator site like Linux Today. Initially, it looks like a series of links:</p>
<p><img src="/media/linuxtoday1.png" /></p>
<p>But, as soon as you click on a link, another full screen, text obstructing ad appears.</p>
<p><img src="/media/linuxtoday2.png" /></p>
<p>OK, fine, close the ad, and see that you still have another link to click on to get to the article you want to read.</p>
<p><img src="/media/linuxtoday3.png" /></p>
<p>Now I’m wondering just how much I care about the Debian Civil War (spoiler: not much), but by this time, I’m invested, let’s read that article. Click the Complete Story link.</p>
<p><img src="/media/linuxtoday4.png" /></p>
<p>Nope! Close the ad, and, finally, find the text I was looking for.</p>
<p><img src="/media/linuxtoday5.png" /></p>
<p>Has it really come to this? Apparently.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-10-27-Sensible_Information_Organization.html'>Sensible Information Organization</a></h2>
<p>There is no one application or system that is right for managing all of your information. If there were, we wouldn’t need apps like Contacts or Calendar, those things would just be merged into the Finder, or whatever mythical computing system I found myself wishing for the past couple of weeks. This is a <em>good thing</em>, even if not having a single view into all my data drives me a bit nuts sometimes. Specialization allows applications to provide a better experience for the specific type of data they were designed to handle. </p>
<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/ibuys/status/526009245368471552">lamented on Twitter</a> the other day that personal information management is still not a solved problem. It’s a hard problem, because everyone’s needs for what they wish to keep and access on a computing device, how much they care about format and privacy, and the interface they prefer for accessing their data are different. What I thought I wanted, and what I spent far too long looking for, was a single application that I could actually dump <em>everything</em> into. It doesn’t exist, and it shouldn’t.</p>
<p>The system I’ve come up with, the system that works for me, and probably only for me, is to corral the different types of data that I wish to keep in different applications, based on what they are, and if I need access to them while mobile. </p>
<h2>Types of Data</h2>
<p>The kind of data I frequently find myself wanting to keep falls into a few categories. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notes - Small pieces of text, normally nothing more than a few lines. Like meeting minutes, lists of books to read, random ideas, etc…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing - Longer articles or blog posts. May include links, images, or other media. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical or Academic Reference - PDFs or Web Archives containing detailed technical information gathered for later reference when writing and professional development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Archived Reference - PDF scans of bills and statements. Needed at times for trend analysis (is our water bill going up?). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disk Images - Install files for applications like Microsoft Office, or downloaded disk images for operating system installs. Rarely needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Screenshots or other images. Sometimes needed to explain or convey ideas, Also collected for inspiration or to indulge a hobby (Someday I’m going to find the perfect 1967 VW Beetle).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scripts or Automator workflows - Home-built tools for automating reproducible Mac workflows. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recipes - Everything from scanned PDFs of my wife’s great-grandmothers notecards, to saved web pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receipts - I need to be able to grab scans of these on the run quickly and easily. Good to have for later analysis of spending habits, and for tracking business expenses while traveling. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Deciding on the right place for this data depends on defining the requirements up front. </p>
<ul>
<li>Data must be stored in, or easily exported to, an open format.</li>
<li>Mobile data must be available and editable on all devices.</li>
<li>It <em>should</em> be fast and easy to get to and add to my data. The less friction in the workflow the better, but not at the expense of the previous two points. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Mapping Purpose to Application</h2>
<p><em>Accessable Only on Local Device</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Financial or Medical Data - Filesystem</li>
<li>Disk Images - Filesystem</li>
<li>Archived Reference Files - Filesystem</li>
<li>Technical or Academic Research - <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/devonthink-pro.html">DEVONthink</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Accessable On Mobile Devices</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Notes    - <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT</a> +  <a href="http://simplenote.com">Simplenote</a></li>
<li>Recipes  - Dropbox - Until <a href="http://forum.devontechnologies.com/viewtopic.php?f=44&amp;t=16944">DTTG 2.0</a>, then we will see. </li>
<li>Receipts - Dropbox + <a href="http://www.smilesoftware.com/PDFpen/Scan/index.html">PDFpen Scan Plus</a> + <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a></li>
<li>Screenshots and other images - <a href="http://realmacsoftware.com/ember">Ember</a></li>
<li>Writing - Dropbox + <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/08-04-2011/Text_Editing_in_MacVim.html">MacVim</a> + <a href="http://nebulousapps.net">Nebulous Notes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For things like the directions to my kids soccer games, dragging and dropping the PDF to nvAlt will extract the text and create a new note. If need be, I can open the note in MacVim and clean up the formatting, then drop the original PDF in the filesystem under archived reference files. </p>
<p>Some data types can benefit from the organization of a database application. For that type of data, I’m leaning on the additional capabilities of DEVONthink to help me process the files and clippings I collect into new knowledge. DEVONthink’s AI engine helps me find connections to other entries that I might not have realized myself, and helps me to build a more solid understanding of the topic.</p>
<p>I think the same basic concept applies to recipes. I’m working on building a system that can take the basic ingredients as search terms and return a collection of recipes, as well as tags for things like “lunch”, “dinner”, and “family favorite”. For now, I’ll keep the recipes in Dropbox and index them in DEVONthink. Hopefully, I’ll soon be able to import them and sync them over to the <a href="http://blog.devontechnologies.com/2013/07/an-update-on-devonthink-to-go/">mythical DEVONthink To Go 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>This system is new to me, but each of the components I’ve been using on and off for years. While I do like to simplify my computing environment, doing so at the expense of a sensible system is foolish. My attempts to combine unlike files and data into the same system failed, but allowing each type of data to be manipulated by an application specifically designed to handle it looks promising. I’ll be sure to post updates as the system evolves.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-09-30-shellshocked-security-specialists.html'>Shellshocked Security Specialists</a></h2>
<p>Between 2000 and 2003 I was part of a small group that was responsible for the security of the network in a remote military base. The work we did there was foundational for the rest of my career, at least so far. Once a week our team shut down for the afternoon to do training, and in the training one of us was responsible for researching a topic in depth and then presenting it to the rest of the team. We built web servers, firewalls, and proxies with OpenBSD, managed our intrusion detection system that we designed and installed ourselves, we even built a honeypot to watch malicious traffic. We spent a lot of long nights, and did a lot of hard work, but it paid off. </p>
<p>Part of the reason this was such a unique experience was the time. The Internet was small, and slow, and the tools we had available were rudimentary and low level. Part of it was the place, we were part of the Navy, but we were remote and isolated, and not under the constant watchful eye of senior brass. We were able to get away with more because there was no one around to tell us we couldn't. But more than either of these, the main reason was Senior. Senior was the Senior Chief in charge of our team, and he was obsessed with security. He taught college level courses for the University of Maryland, would speak at the annual Black Hat conference, and did security consulting on the side. I recently learned he's also an author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kevin-Cardwell/e/B00IXFSODO/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1">several books</a>. His obsession with security was only met by his obsession with education, and because we were his team, we were the beneficiaries of both. </p>
<p>So, for years, night and day, we built servers, ran scans, performed penetration testing, and researched, researched, researched. We were all in front of the firehose. </p>
<p>It was fantastic. </p>
<p>I left the security field shortly after transferring out of the team. I simply couldn't stand the level of incompetence in the general IT population among so called "security specialists". The field outside of our team was composed of people concerned with paperwork, and constant one-upmanship. This kind of security specialist seemed more interested in telling you what you couldn't do than building things that let you do the things you want. I'm a builder. </p>
<p>The recent hubbub over the so named "shellshock" vulnerability in bash reminded me again of why I left the security field. I was invited to a live screencast with a chat room put on by a big name in the security industry, so I logged on to have a few things clarified. I was unimpressed. </p>
<p>The vulnerability in bash is only remotely exploitable if your web application is calling out to bash, and specifically bash. The presenters came up with a few ideas when I asked them for clarification on the specifics, but they seemed contrived to me. I asked about perl CGI's, and they said it's possible that the application could be vulnerable if perl called out to bash for any exec() or system calls, but when I asked for specifics they didn't have any. I doubt that would work, since perl would need to pass along the maligned bash environmental variables, but I'd be willing to be proven wrong. </p>
<p>Secondly, they said that "similar to heartbleed", some applications could precompile bash for inclusion instead of depending on the system bash. I asked if they could provide an example of an application that did that, but they could not. I have never heard of an application doing that, and if I found one, I think it would be incredibly poor development practices. That would be an application to avoid at all costs. I asked on Twitter if anyone else had heard of something like that, but received no response. </p>
<p>These kinds of statements are a problem because they are inaccurate and generalizing in a field that depends on exact and precision correctness. It doesn't change the fact that the bug still needs to be patched, just to cover the areas we don't know about, but having a correct understanding of what the exposure of the bug is, how it can be exploited, and where there is an actual emergency speaks volumes about the reliability and trustworthiness of the vendor. </p>
<p>Someone can only cry wolf so many times. The heartbleed bug was worth staying up all night to fix. This, as far as I can tell, is not.  That doesn't stop the security firms and media outlets from getting excited about it though. </p>
<p>This kind of fear mongering doesn't help anyone. What does help people is having the right information so they can make intelligent, informed choices that are right for them. Senior would never have let the kind of flippant comments I heard, being presented as fact from a trusted source, leave the meeting without providing proof. To do so not only makes you look incompetent, but reflects poorly on the entire industry. Are you in this to help protect people? Or just to make a buck?   </p>
<p>Finally, there is this garbage of an article by ZDNet: <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/apple-issues-os-x-patch-for-shellshock-7000034170/">Apple issues incomplete OS X patch for Shellshock</a>, which claims that the patch issued by Apple did not patch for all listed CVE vulnerabilities, when, according to my testing, it does. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Testing by ZDNet showed that while the patch fixed the issues outlined in the original CVE-2014-6271 report and CVE-2014-7169, OS X remains vulnerable to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_%28software_bug%29#CVE-2014-7186">CVE-2014-7186</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ran the tests on my machine for both CVE-2014-7186 and CVE-2014-7187, and both return as not being vulnerable. </p>
<p>I don't mean to demean the importance of fixing the bug, I simply want to make sure the it is correctly and accurately understood. Tech journalists and security specialists alike benefit from sensational claims, which is a shame when there are so many more pressing problems in the world they could be working on. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-09-29-A_Technical_Education_Operating_Systems.html'>A Technical Education - The Operating System</a></h2>
<p>It’s good to think of a computer as something like a cake with several layers. If the hardware is the first, and foundational layer, then the operating system is the second, and applications are the third. Today, we are going to look at that second layer, and leave with a basic understanding of what an operating system is, what it does, and what the differences are between the major operating systems available today.</p>
<p>Chances are, you’ve already heard of a few operating systems, even if you didn’t know what the differences meant. Microsoft’s Windows is the most well known and popular operating system, powering the majority of desktop and laptop computers sold for many years now. Apple has two operating systems, OS X for desktop and notebook computers, and iOS for iPhones and iPads. Likewise, Google has two operating systems, Android and Chrome OS, both based on the open source (more on that term at a later date) Linux kernel. </p>
<p>An operating system (OS) has two major functions. The first is to provide control of, and access to the hardware of the computer. Without an operating system, when a computer powers on it will simply sit there with nothing to do. Computers have a small built-in OS, conveniently called the BIOS, which provides access to some very basic settings, but it’s main job is to find the disk that contains the real OS and start it, or “boot it up”. </p>
<p>When the BIOS finds the operating system, the first thing it does is load the kernel into memory. The kernel is the core of the operating system, the control point that manages access to all other resources of the machine. If there is a problem in the kernel, the entire computer crashes, which, thankfully, doesn’t happen all that often anymore. Next, a series of other programs are started that manage various functions of the computer. Eventually, the OS finishes starting all the programs that it needs to provide all the background services we rely on, and it is ready for the user. </p>
<p>The second function of an operating system is to provide a framework for third party applications to build on. The OS provides hooks and libraries, reusable blocks of code made available to other applications to give the OS a unified and cohesive look and feel, no matter which application is in use. For example, if an application wants to draw a window on the screen, the developer doesn’t have to write all the code required to draw the window herself, she simply has to make the right calls to the OS and have the system draw the window for her. There are thousands of these programming interfaces available on each OS, but each OS does things differently. Windows not only <em>looks</em> different from OS X, it <em>feels</em> different too, that’s because the way that it functions, and the programming interfaces that it presents to third party developers are very, very different internally from OS X. </p>
<p>This is why applications made for one operating system are often not available for another, and if they are, sometimes they look and feel a bit out of place. This is also why you can’t simply move an application from one OS to another and expect it to work. There are other, more technical explanations that have to do with compilers and runtime environments and interrupts, but for now, the important thing to understand is that applications are tied fairly deeply into the OS they were built to support. </p>
<p>One last item that is important to understand is the concept of <em>device drivers</em>. Let’s say you have a printer, and that printer comes with a USB cable that you plug into your computer. Your computer needs to know how to talk to that printer in a way it understands, so when the paper is printed, it looks the way it should. Operating systems use a special program known as a device driver that is normally provided by the manufacturer of the printer (or whatever other device you want to connect to) and developed specifically for your operating system. Device drivers have special privileges that allow them to talk to the hardware, and allow other programs or applications to talk to the driver. </p>
<p>Modern operating systems include drivers for thousands of different devices, and a mechanism that allows them to automatically download new drivers when they come across a device they don’t currently have. However, there may still be times when the operating system doesn’t know what to do with the device that’s plugged into it, and you may have to load the driver yourself. Normally, the manufacturer includes an installer along with the device, but unless the device is brand new, it might be a problem to install it. Third party manufacturers don’t move at the same speed as operating system development, so the drivers are often behind. Since device drivers operate at a low level in the operating system, having one that is out of date or faulty in some way can be a source of system instability. If the device you are loading a driver for is more than a year old, or if the stated supported operating system on the box is older than the one you are using, the best thing to do is visit the manufacturers web site and download and up to date driver. However, remember that that is only if the operating system doesn’t automatically do that for you.  </p>
<p>So, the basics of an operating system are that it manages access to the hardware, provides a framework for third party development, and manages the drivers needed for extending the computer with third-party devices. This just barely skims the top of what an operating system is and can do, if you’d like to know more, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">Wikipedia article</a> is a great next step.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-09-20-A_Technical_Education_-_Base_Level_Knowledge.html'>A Technical Education - Base Level Hardware</a></h2>
<p>The first and most important thing to remember when considering a computer is that computers are machines. Incredible, wondrous, bordering on magical machines, but machines nonetheless. They were built by people who are no smarter than you, and designed by people every bit as fallible as you. There are no magic incantations, no special spells, and no generational gap that make one group of people better able to understand computers than another. Computers are machines, machines that <strong>you</strong> can understand. </p>
<p>So let's get started.</p>
<p>Viewing a computer from the outside, there are four main components. Normally two ways to interact with the computer, a mouse and a keyboard. There will be a way to view the results of your interaction through the monitor, the screen that is the most visible part of the machine, and there will be the case that encloses the actual guts of the machine, the engine if you will. </p>
<p>These main external parts are present in computers of all sizes, even a smart phone, although the input mechanism and the screen have been combined. </p>
<p>Inside the case, all computers share the same basic components: CPU, RAM, storage, networking, and input and output ports. Let's go over each component. </p>
<p><em>CPU</em> </p>
<p>The central processing unit, CPU, can be considered the brain of the computer. At a high level, you can think of it as making decisions, very simple decisions, very, very quickly. The speed at which it makes these decisions is measured in hertz. A CPU that operated at one hertz would make one decision per second, but that would be an incredibly slow computer. Most computers now work with CPU's measured in Gigahertz. For example, the computer I'm using to type this on has a CPU speed of 2.66 GHz, which means it can make 2,660,000,000 decisions per second. </p>
<p>Secondly, most CPUs come with multiple <em>cores</em>. A single CPU with two or more cores can be thought of as having the ability to make more than one decision, or threads of decisions, at a time. Each core runs at the same speed, but can operate on different information.</p>
<p>Generally, the faster the CPU speed, the faster the computer can process information, which <em>should</em> make it feel faster to the user. However, the other parts of the computer contribute to the overall feel of responsiveness too. </p>
<p><em>RAM</em></p>
<p>While the CPU is working on making all those decisions, it needs a place to put things. RAM, which stands for Random Access Memory, and is also known as primary storage, is a fast, convenient place for the CPU to put things that it’s currently working on, or that it has worked on recently, and might work on again. Here’s an example: if you open up a document in Word, everything you are typing into the document is being stored in RAM, up until the moment you choose to save the document. Unfortunately, RAM doesn’t persist between reboots, so everything that is saved <em>only</em> in RAM is lost if the computer reboots. If we want to save things on the computer for good, we have to save it to <em>secondary storage</em>, also known as the hard drive. </p>
<p><em>Storage</em></p>
<p>There are two options for storage in computers today: traditional spinning disk hard drives, and the newer and much, much faster solid state drives, called SSDs. Hard drives are slow because on the inside there is a metal platter spinning at thousands of revolutions per second, and a mechanical arm holding a head that moves across the disk to read and write the data. While advances in hard drive technology have made access faster over time, the physical limitations of the mechanics make this part the slowest on the computer. </p>
<p>On the other hand, an SSD has no moving parts, and access to reading and writing the data is done entirely electronically. An SSD is an order of magnitude faster than a hard drive, but for the moment it holds less data and is more expensive than hard drives. That’s the trade off, today, you either pay more for a faster computer with less storage, or less for a slower computer with more storage. </p>
<p>In my opinion, the price of solid state drives has come down enough that unless you know you need <em>lots</em> of internal storage, go for the SSD. It will make the entire computer feel faster.</p>
<p><em>Networking</em></p>
<p>Networking is a complex topic, and to fully understand it is beyond the scope of this introductory article. In a future ATE article we will cover the basics of how the Internet works, but not today. Suffice to say that there are two forms of networking to be concerned with: wired and wireless. Wireless, or WiFi, uses a small radio inside of the computer to connect to a network. The stronger the signal, and the less interference there is with the signal, the better your connection will be. Generally, if you are connecting at home or at school, your computer will share a network with other devices, and will connect to one or more wireless routers or access points. The router will most likely connect to a cable modem (assuming a home network), and the cable modem provides access to the Internet. </p>
<p>Wired networking uses a standard called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a>. Basically, there is a cable that connects your computer to a router, and the router connects to the modem for Internet access. Again, there are trade-offs. Wireless access is simple to setup, and lets you move your computer all around your house or school without loosing access to the Internet. The cost of this convenience is speed. Although WiFI is getting faster, it is still nowhere near as fast or as reliable as a directly cabled connection. </p>
<p>For me, the convenience of wireless outweighs the speed and reliability benefits of a wired connection. If I used a desktop computer that was always in the same spot, then a wired connection would make far more sense. </p>
<p><em>Input/Output Ports</em></p>
<p>Along the side or back of your computer will be a series of ports; different shaped plugs for different types of cables. These ports allow you to connect additional devices to your computer to extend the usefulness of the machine. For example, you may wish to add an external display to a notebook computer, and would plug into the mini-display port. Or, you may wish to plug in an external hard drive to backup your computer, and would plug the drive into the Universal Serial Bus (USB) port. There are normally ports for headphones and microphones, and possibly a place to plug in storage cards from cameras. </p>
<p>Most modern computers will allow you to plug a device into one of these ports have have the computer automatically configure the device for use. Don’t be afraid to plug something in, and if it doesn’t work, don’t be afraid to pull it back out again. That’s what the ports are there for. Some devices, like hard drives, want to be “ejected” before pulling the cable out of the computer, but even that may soon be a thing of the past. </p>
<p><em>Motherboard</em></p>
<p>One last part I forgot to mention above: the motherboard. Also known as the “system board”, the motherboard is the glue that connects all the other components together. Everything connects to the motherboard, and thin strips of conductive material printed onto the board called the bus connect the different parts together. </p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>You look at the screen, type on the keyboard, and interact with the mouse or touchpad. Internally, the computer uses the CPU to make decisions, stores things temporarily in RAM, writes data permanently to a storage drive, connects to the Internet over a wired or wireless network connection, and is extensible via the input/output ports. And, all the different parts connect through the motherboard. </p>
<p>Now that we’ve covered the basics of hardware, next week we will talk about some of the software that makes the machine come to life.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-09-12-A_Technical_Education.html'>A Technical Education</a></h2>
<p>I didn't grow up with computers. They just weren't a common thing in Montana in the 80’s. When my family moved to Texas for two years during my sixth and seventh grades, one of my friends had one in her room that we would play Oregon Trail on, but otherwise it was unremarkable. With the exception of video games and VHS tapes, my childhood was very much like the childhoods of the generations before me. If I wanted to see a friend, I'd have to walk over to his house. If I wanted to send someone a letter, I had to sit down and write it out on paper, scratching out misspellings along the way, then folding it up, stuffing it in an envelope, licking a stamp on it, and dropping it in the mailbox. And then, I’d wait. Sometimes for weeks, sometimes for months. In the past twenty years however, our world has changed dramatically. </p>
<p>If my daughter wants to talk to someone, she pulls out her phone and sends a text. If she wants to send a longer message, she might, if pressed, sit down at her Mac and send an email. Then she waits five or ten minutes, tops, for a reply. More likely, during those ten minutes she's sent a Facebook message and posted to Twitter. Computers and the Internet have changed how we interact with each other, and technology has improved faster than our culture and education system has been able to adapt to it. </p>
<p>What are these magic boxes that have intruded on our lives? How do they function? How can we best use them? How can we ensure that we become their master, and not the other way around? There are websites, games, and apps that have become very good at exploiting basic human psychology to extract our personal information, time, and money. </p>
<p>Education is the first and best defense against those who would use our ignorance against us. In the past twenty years, computers have barged their way into the spotlight of nearly every facet of our personal and professional lives, but they are <em>not</em> magic. </p>
<p>I'm starting a series of posts here where we are going to pull back the curtain and see that the wizard is, yet, just a man. We will examine the inner workings of the machine, the components that make up the whole. By the time we finish, you will be able to identify the basic hardware components of a computer and their function, explain what an operating system is and how the main options differ, have a basic understanding of what the Internet is and how it works, and make educated and informed choices about online services. </p>
<p>Reading this series won't make you an expert on computers, but it is my goal to give you the basic knowledge required to operate computers confidently, and discuss the available options intelligently. </p>
<p>Look for weekly updates to A Technical Education right here.</p>

<p>GigaOm is <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/09/07/weve-reached-the-end-of-build-it-yourself-software/">running an article</a> written by Ralph Dangelmaier, the CEO of BlueSnap, claiming “We’ve reached the end of ‘build it yourself’ software.” It’s a nice thought, along the same lines as “We’ve reached the end of ‘host it yourself hardware’,” and “We’ve reached the end of you needing anything other than what someone else has already developed.” In the past fourteen years I’ve been in the industry though, the systems I’ve seen run the best are the ones hosted on our own hardware running our own code. Off-the-shelf software can be great for certain situations, but if you are outsourcing a core function of your business, what kind of value are you really providing? </p>
<p>Admittedly, building your own software from scratch is too much for most. However, if you use the building blocks of open source correctly, you gain the best of both worlds. Functionality and flexibility. </p>
<p>Dangelmaier’s claims center around an odd story of a company nearly sixty years ago who started building entire houses using an assembly chain technique. The company could spit out up to thirty homes per day; thirty identical homes. I’m sure they were affordable at the time, what I wonder is how many of those homes are still standing today. When applying that same thought process to software systems, the concept of being able to slightly customize assembly line software starts to break down as soon as the needs of the business start bumping up against the upper limits of the purchased software. </p>
<p>If you never need to run that Windows only application on anything other than a single server, you might be fine. As soon as you need to expand that system to provide high availability, failover, or disaster recovery, things start to fall apart, and costs go through the roof. The initial pain of developing the software yourself is made up for later by having the flexibility to modernize and adapt your system to changing times. </p>
<p>I've recently started looking at building out my own system based on FreeBSD jails. I've had a fascination with what I call the beautiful system for years, I think it's high time I stopped making prototypes and built something worthwhile.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-09-10-The_Apple_I_Knew.html'>The Apple I Knew</a></h2>
<p><img src="/media/UNIXad.png" /></p>
<p>As usual, <a href="(http://daringfireball.net/2014/09/apple_watch)">John Gruber</a> has the best take on the Apple Watch that I’ve read, and one sentence in particular stood out. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather, I think Apple Watch is the first product from an Apple that has outgrown the computer industry. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Apple that is releasing that watch is not the same scrappy underdog from decades past. This is the new Apple, a massive powerhouse making <em>the best</em> products in the industries they enter. Computers, phones, tablets, and now, watches. This isn’t the same Apple that advertised their new operating system to Unix geeks. </p>
<p>Or, is it?</p>
<p>I don’t think the Apple Watch is a product designed for me, and that’s fine. I’m happy to see Apple grow and mature, as long as we keep seeing hints that they are still the same company with the same values, simply expressed in different ways. The Apple in the Unix ad above valued simplicity, beauty, power, and obsessive attention to detail. When I look at that watch I see the expression of those values in a new product. </p>
<p>The Unix ad above drew me to the Mac, and I’ve stayed because of the community. The community came together because we all shared the values we saw expressed in the products Apple made, and in their own statements. There are always going to be a few missteps along the way, some ham-handed attempts, and inelegant solutions. There will be times when Apple does things that are embarrassing, or just flat out wrong, but they’ve been doing that all along.</p>
<p>Sometimes they don’t pay quite close enough attention in their betas, which worries us:</p>
<div class="bbpBox" id="t511874650297872385">
<blockquote>
<span class="twContent">Why am I worried about iOS 8?

<p>Sometimes we see trends with their software quality that worry us:</p>

</div>

<p>But, really, these are things we’ve been seeing all along. In fact, it used to be common knowledge that a new OS X release would not be stable till at least the 10.x.3 release. </p>
<p>One of the endearing qualities of Apple is that their grasp <em>almost always</em> exceeds their reach. They are daring greatly, aspiring to do things that the tech industry simply doesn’t understand, and that they may or may not be able to pull off. Stretching a little further, a little wider, straining at times to accomplish their goal. </p>
<p>I think Gruber is right, he normally is, and that the Apple Watch will sell well. How the Mac, OS X, and the rest of the ecosystem evolve along with Apple will be exciting to watch. </p>

<p>If you really, <em>really</em> care about Markdown, Jeff Atwood of Coding Horror and Stack Exchange fame has a <a href="http://standardmarkdown.com">new project for you</a>. Apparently, Jeff didn't think <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/08/markdown_10">Markdown's original creator's</a> care of the code was quite up to snuff, and decided to build a new project to more accurately codify the syntax and implementation details. All good things, if, again, you <em>really</em> care about such details. If, however, you are using Markdown like the majority of us: to making writing on the web a bit easier, well, this all might go by unnoticed. At least, it probably would have if Jeff had named his project anything other than "<strong>Standard Markdown</strong>". </p>
<p>Markdown has two parts. First, a very bare syntax that defines things like links, italics, and headings. Second, a small, but very clever perl script that parses the Markdown text and converts it into HTML markup. Over the years several other people have written their own parsers for Markdown text, which has led to a fantastic array of available editors and parsers for all platforms, which allows writers to concentrate on writing, and not get bogged down in the details of actually putting our text on the web. Jeff's heartache seems to be that each of these parsers rendered HTML a bit differently. Gruber has no problem with that, and, for what it's worth, neither do I, but it seems to bother Atwood quite a bit. </p>
<p>There is only one "standard" markdown, and it's a perl script written in 2004, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">hosted at Daring Fireball</a>. Everything else is a derivative work, and for Atwood to claim the name Standard Markdown is wrong. He did not create the syntax or the original parser, and that he is unsatisfied with the handling of the pair is immaterial. It doesn't matter how he feels about it, he should name his project something else. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually don't care all that much about whether there is a spec for Markdown. I use various aspects of the language all day every day. I use it on every computer I touch. That's a statement against Jeff Atwood's express motivation. I've never once cared about the project's stewardship. I care that it is not complicated and it's easy to read.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gruber created something that he wanted to use, then put it out there for the world to use, and in the ten years since he last updated it, Markdown has become extremely popular. However, just because the idea became popular does not mean that anyone is entitled to demand anything more from the original creator. Markdown works for me every day, and I imagine it will continue to do so as long as perl works, no matter what the spec is.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-07-11-Small_Site_Update.html'>Small Site Update</a></h2>
<p>I've been publishing this site with Jekyll for several years. I'm not sure exactly when I switched over from Wordpress, but it's long enough ago that I've forgotten when I started.[^footer] Over the past few weeks I've run into a few issues with Jekyll that have caused me to reevaluate if it was still the right choice for me. The short answer is no, the long answer is that this site is now published with my own Python script. </p>
<p><em>List of Grievances</em></p>
<p>Jekyll is popular enough with the geek crowd that there are probably reasonable solutions to everything listed below. However, that would assume that I'm reasonable, which I think we've established is not always the case. And besides, something <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2014/07/displaying-multiple-images-in-twitter/">Dr. Drang said</a> the other day has been stuck in my head:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the great advantage of making your own software is that you can customize it to match your own idiosyncrasies. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, 370 lines of Python. On to the motivation to move. </p>
<ul>
<li>Dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Strictly speaking, there are not <em>that</em> many Ruby <a href="https://gemnasium.com/jekyll/jekyll">dependencies for Jekyll</a>, and the are all automatically installed when running <code>gem install jekyll</code>. To be able to compile the gems, you need to have either the full Xcode IDE installed, or at a minimum the Xcode command line tools. Not much, still more than I thought necessary to parse text and move files.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Lost Pages</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the ways I used Jekyll was to build an internal site where I work. I use the site to keep coworkers updated with what I'm working on, but more importantly I use the site to publish reports. The reports are kept in a separate "/reports" directory under the site root, and Jekyll used to automatically compile the markdown to html in that directory along with the rest of the site. I'm not sure what happened, but at some point that stopped working, and when I rsync'd my site using the "--delete" flag, all my reports were gone. Luckily, I had a backup so I was able to quickly restore the reports, but once I realized what had happened I had to rethink my "modern living document". [^footer2] A process I was in the middle of when I encountered the next grievance. </p>
<ul>
<li>Failure to Build Site</li>
</ul>
<p>Jekyll failed to build my site last week because of a UTF-8 error; it was all I needed to start looking for something else. Apparently there was a special character in the title of one of my posts. Again, this wasn't anything new, that post must have been built before because I wasn't building anything new at the time. Something changed, I don't know what, and troubleshooting this error led me down a rabbit hole of Ruby bugs I didn't want to go down. </p>
<p><em>Options</em></p>
<p>I evaluated, and discarded, several options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wordpress.com</li>
<li>Self-Hosted Wordpress</li>
<li>Squarespace</li>
<li>Ghost</li>
<li>Hakyll</li>
<li>Hyde</li>
<li>Hugo</li>
</ul>
<p>I briefly looked at a few others, but these were the ones that received the most thought. </p>
<p>[^footer]: There was, of course, Paragraphs, but I'm content to let that go. Making peace with your past, learning from your mistakes, and moving on older and wiser is the only way to live in peace. </p>
<p>[^footer2]: My term for an internal, corporate blog. I maintain it as a way to avoid emailing Word documents and PowerPoint presentations to each other. When someone wants something like that from me, they get a link to an HTML document.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-06-10-What_it_Does.html'>What it Does</a></h2>
<p>Our relationship with technology has become unexpectedly skewed. I was just reading through Sid O’Neill's recent article, <a href="http://crateofpenguins.com/blog/losing-apple">Losing Apple</a>, and found myself nodding along on several points, particularly here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How did it come to this? Time was I loved poetry, literature, art, music, cheap wine and the smell of an old book. Now my spare moments are spent rubbing glass: from the latest $AAPL share price, to the wildest speculative mockup, to the newest analysis. Levels upon levels of inconsequential meandering in flat prose that I’ve rolled and wrapped myself in like a musty felt blanket till I almost forgot the taste of fresh air.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have watched the WWDC, and I was excited when all the new fancy was revealed, but a couple of days later I found myself wondering what exactly I was so excited about. I tried to recall a specific feature that I was looking forward to and momentarily came up blank. The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">new language</a> sounds great, but I don't have time to learn a programming language right now, or to develop a new app. I'm genuinely excited about the new look and feel of <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/preview/">Yosemite</a>, but I'll most likely be waiting till the Fall to install on my daily driver at work. </p>
<p>I'm excited for the people I know at Apple who have done such great work and have been a part of something so big. I'm also happy that the developers of many of my favorite third-party apps are excited about iOS 8 and Yosemite, because it means that the apps I use every day will continue to get better. Thinking back on watching the <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2014/">CraigNote</a>, I was excited because it felt great to see <em>our team</em> winning, it felt great to be a part of something, even if I was just a small, insignificant part. Being part of the Apple community for the past ten years, it's exciting to see what we believe in succeed. </p>
<p>But, what else? Why do we become so enthralled by these machines? </p>
<p>I believe that whenever we choose to align ourselves with a particular product, brand, or organization, we do so because what we perceive as their values or the values they claim line up with our own. In the case of "<a href="http://5by5.tv">Apple and related technologies</a>", those values are simplicity, beauty, and technical excellence. What burns some of us out, like what I believe may be happening to O’Neill, is that we focus far too much on how those values are expressed in the products, and far too little on the actual usefulness we get from Apple's investment. In other words, it's what they do that defines them.  </p>
<p>What we love about Apple products frees us to get real work done. That's one of the most interesting differences between Apple and Android advertising. Android ads, particularly the older Droid ads focused on what the phone was. Apple's ads focus on what the device allows you to do. Play baseball, fix a windmill, conduct an orchestra, travel the world with a disability. <em>Live</em>. Live your life without worrying if your chosen tools are going to work or not. The promise that Apple makes, and the deal we make with Apple when we buy from them, is that we give them our money, and they give us devices that work. </p>
<p>We need <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href="http://www.macstories.net">Shawn Blanc</a>, <a href="http://www.macstories.net">MacStories</a>, <a href="http://macsparky.com">MacSparky</a>, <a href="http://stratechery.com">Stratechery</a>, and of course Dr. Drang. These writers inform and inspire us, they show us how we can do more with our machines, and they explore the details we appreciate. What we don't need is an echo chamber constantly reverberating the same small set of words. If you have something to say, then say it, if you find joy and belonging in the community, then participate. But don't let the obsessions of others get in the way of what your life is meant to be. Find your own passion, and pursue it relentlessly. Pick tools that you can rely on, and that reflect your values, and then get out there and do something great.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"UNLESS someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better, it's not."  -- The Lorax</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that it is my responsibility to have an understanding of my impact on the world around me, and who and what I support, either implicitly or explicitly, by the products I use. Not everything easy is right, and not everything cool is good. I try to do the right thing whenever I can, balancing the needs of my family and the culture we live in. Sometimes, there's no good answer, but sometimes, as in the latest case of sexism in the tech industry, the answer is clear. </p>
<p>I've removed my site and all code from Github, and deleted my account. Based on the report by <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/15/5512462/github-developer-leaves-alleging-gender-harassment">Julie Ann Horvath</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1823-results-of-the-github-investigation">vague response</a> by Github, and the <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/ims-and-email-support-allegations-about-the-toxic-cultu-1567175545">storm</a> of <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/28/5662174/github-apologizes-for-vagueness-reveals-new-details-about-sexism">coverage</a> that has followed the issue, as well as resurfacing of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130117043748/http://sheddingbikes.com/posts/1306816425.html">past stories</a>, I've decided not to do business with the company. I've had an account on Github for years, and used Jekyll and Github Pages to host this site for at least the past three years. As of yesterday, I've moved the site to <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net">Nearly Free Speech.net</a>. I'll be considering switching from Jekyll to another static blogging engine. In fact, I <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/03-28-2013/Paragraphs.html">built one</a> that I might resurrect. </p>
<p>My actions are small, and completely inconsequential to Github, but they mean something to me. I cannot, in good conscience, continue to support an organization run by an immature boy's club. There is a sickness in the industry, something that has been pervasive in geek culture <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_incidents">for years</a>. The objectifying of women in the industry and our culture is damaging to everyone involved. One might not think that one woman getting harassed at a silicon valley darling is that big of a deal, not worth starting a tempest in a teapot, <a href="http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/attorney-for-internet-mogul-gurbaksh-chahal-call-domestic-violence-charges-overblown/Content?oid=2540544">but is it</a>? <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Hans_Reiser">Is it really</a>? </p>
<p>It is wrong to have business meetings at strip clubs. It is wrong to yell out sexual jokes across the office. It is wrong to treat women as being anything other than equals. Treat them as you would wish to be treated.  </p>
<p>Culture is made up of who we are together. One person making a change might not matter, but it's a start. Perhaps soon it's one, then another, then another, and another, and eventually those who care become the majority, and the culture has changed. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-03-23-An_Investment_of_Time_and_Software.html'>Site Design Non-Update</a></h2>
<p>The site design of <em>jb</em> was very nearly upgraded tonight. Well, upgraded is not quite the word for it. Changed is more accurate. Even though I'm quite happy with the look and feel of the site, from time to time I get frustrated with one aspect of it or another. I've spent more time that I want to admit thinking about readability, fonts, font sizes, spacing, kerning, and the like, but occasionally I'll look at another site and think "that looks <em>good</em>". And then mine looks like crap for a day or so. </p>
<p>The most recent bout of site envy came while reading a <a href="http://www.drbunsen.org/ski-it-if-you-can-meta/">recent post</a> by the brilliant Dr. Bunsen[^sdnu1]. His entire site is worth reading, some posts several times. I decided to do a bit of HTML spelunking and see what the source revealed, and saw several references to the <a href="http://purecss.io">Pure CSS</a> framework. I hadn't heard of this one before, so I downloaded it and set up a new Jekyll powered site with the base blog layout. It looked fine, it works as advertised, but it would obviously take a lot of work to tweak it to look just the way I wanted it to. </p>
<p>After running through this exercise I went back and thought about what I don't like about my site right now, and realized that it is not the overall look of the site that I'm not happy with, it is a few details that are nagging at me. For one, code syntax highlighting is not working, and for two, the Bigfoot footnotes were not lining up properly on the home page. I solved the latter problem by only showing only one post on the home page at a time, but the former is still bothering me.</p>
<p>The funny part of it is that one of the reasons syntax highlighting is not working is that I'm not using the default Jekyll Markdown converter. In order to get footnotes to work the way I want them to, I'm using <a href="http://kramdown.gettalong.org">Kramdown</a>, which doesn't use Pygments, but can be configured to use Coderay. I have the settings for Coderay, but so far they don't seem to be doing anything. None of my inserted code is rendered with anything but "code" and "pre" tags. Ah well, this site remains, as always, a work in progress. </p>
<p>It's always a good exercise to try out a completely different way of doing things. Even when I decide to scrap the work and keep things the way they are, I still count it as progress made. </p>

<p>I still need an <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2009/09/yojimbo-and-anything-buckets/">anything bucket</a>, and nothing fills that gap like my old friend Yojimbo. I was an early adopter of Yojimbo, back with version one, and I upgraded faithfully for version 2 and version 3, but I held off for a long time on version 4. In the mean time I tried Evernote, DEVONthink, Pinboard, and just the file system to fill the void that Yojimbo filled so gracefully. No more, I've come home, and it feels great to be here. </p>
<p>Back before I used a Mac for work, I used it for fun. It was fun to grab random stuff off the web that I wanted to keep and save. I like collecting things, mainly maps, pictures of old 60's era Volkswagens, and British motorcycles. I also like to grab quotes I've found inspirational, designs that I love and want to go back to, funny pictures of cats and dogs, and whatever other random thing catches my eye. </p>
<p><a href="/media/yojimbo_screen_shot.png"><img src="/media/yojimbo_screen_shot_thumb.png" /></a>
When I bought my first iPhone, I found that I wanted to be able to collect things on the go as well as on the web. Pictures of artwork at a store, or a quick note about a blender. Without a proper Yojimbo client for iOS, most of that stuff was lost. I tried to use Evernote or DEVONthink To Go, but neither tool really clicked with me. </p>
<p>Nothing else works like Yojimbo. The web clients like Pinterest are too slow, and Pinboard is too basic. I can't just browse through pictures of things in Pinboard. I really don't like having to rely on the web. As long as I have a Mac I can get to my Yojimbo database, one way or another.</p>
<p>Yojimbo <em>feels</em> right. Not for work, not for a project management system or detailed information store. That's not what I use it for; I have a system for that. Yojimbo is for everything else, all the fun stuff that I find and want to keep. In the end, Yojimbo 4 works great, and recaptures some of the magic that made me fall in love with the Mac. I keep it just for the fun of it.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-02-10-Converging_Mobile_and_Desktop_Environments.html'>Converging Mobile and Desktop Environments</a></h2>
<p><a href="/media/Colossus.jpg"><img src="/media/Colossus_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Computing has been on a linear progression towards smaller, more mobile, and more personal devices for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computers">seventy years</a>. It seems unlikely to me that the notebook computer is going to be the last iteration of "real" computers for the foreseeable future. Critics can point to the <a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/what-heck-happening-windows">failure of Windows 8</a> as proof that the market doesn't want a converged device, but I would argue that they simply went about it the wrong way. There are two different interaction mechanisms between mobile and desktop, but the infrastructure below the user interface could be shared.</p>
<p>What if the desktop was an app? Everything inside of your desktop computer, the entire world of OS X, wrapped up in an app that launches automatically when your mobile device is docked. If your phone rings, pick it up and your desktop goes away for a few minutes. When you are done, put it back.[^1] It's not ideal for everyone, but it is an interaction model that would work. It's a trade off. </p>
<p>When your iPhone is not docked, there would be no need for desktop metaphors in the iOS user interface. Sit down to do some work, and you have everything you always had in OS X, including the Terminal. Windows could have done this too. When the device is mobile, show the Metro interface, when it is docked, default back to a Windows 7 interface. I'm not alone, Canonical is <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/phone/operators-and-oems">working on this for Ubuntu</a>. However, with Ubuntu's spotty record for usability, stability, and performance I have doubts about Canonical bringing a viable product to market. I have high hopes, but I think this is going to have to come from Apple. Once again, they won't be the first to market, but they have the opportunity to be the first on the market to do it <em>right</em>. </p>
<p><a href="/media/ubuntu-converged.jpg"><img src="/media/ubuntu-converged_thumb.jpg" /></a> </p>
<p>I think the argument that the phone hardware is not powerful enough to do this is shortsighted. History has shown that hardware becomes faster smaller over time, it is conceivable that the current "<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2048483/apple-unveils-powerful-iphone-5s-and-entry-level-5c.html">desktop class</a>" chip in the iPhone 5S could run all of the applications on your desktop right now, if they were recompiled for the architecture. Will desktop hardware always be more powerful than mobile? Probably. Will it matter? Probably not. Why? For the same reason we don't all have servers sitting on our desks, we just don't need that level of power in our day to day tasks. </p>
<p>There are obviously many pitfalls to this concept as well. What about those notebook computers? They could be shells where a phone slides into it like a CD-ROM does today, though that sounds a bit clunky. Perhaps a better idea is that if you still need a notebook than you get one, but maybe more and more people will not. </p>
<p>I wrote about this topic for <a href="http://ostatic.com/blog/ubuntu-phone-looks-like-the-future-of-computing">OStatic</a> last year, and I stand by what I said. The Ubuntu phone concept does look like the future of computing, what I can't see is how far out that future is. </p>
<p>[^1]: Or, you know, answer the phone in an OS X phone app, like Skype.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-01-27-Command-T_Crashing_Vim.html'>Command-T Crashing Vim</a></h2>
<p>For some reason today when I opened up MacVim and hit ,t to navigate to a file, MacVim crashed. The terminal spat out an ugly, and unhelpful error about "deadly signal SEGV", but knowing that I just invoked the Command-T plugin, the error was easy to track down. Command-T is not like other plugins that I have installed with Pathogen, it lives on its own and is not updated as a Git submodule. </p>
<p>To fix the error, all I needed to do is download the latest version of Command-T as a ".vba" file and run through the install again. The install procedure is <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025">fairly simple</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To install open the vimball archive in Vim: </p>
<p>vim command-t.vba </p>
<p>Then source it: </p>
<p><code>:so %</code> </p>
<p>The C extension must also be then compiled; for instance, if Vimball installs your plugin files in ~/.vim, then you would do this: </p>
</blockquote>
<p>{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/.vim/ruby/command-t 
ruby extconf.rb 
make 
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>And now everything is back to normal. Command-T is a great plugin, I recommend it. My latest adventures in Vim are available on <a href="https://github.com/jbuys/MyVim">Github</a>, if you'd like to follow along.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-01-25-Parsing_IOStat_Results.html'>Parsing iostat Results</a></h2>
<p>In the course of load testing a new system, we gathered the output from <a href="http://man.cx/iostat">iostat</a> from a group of servers. In addition to parsing through the device statistics, we thought it would be handy to graph the CPU stats as well. We set iostat to run every five seconds and captured the output in a text file, one per server. This gave me a sizable pool of data, but with everything I needed on separate lines. </p>
<p>{% highlight bash %}</p>
<p>Time: 18:00:01
avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle
           0.79    0.03    0.48    0.06    0.00   98.64</p>

sda1              0.00         0.00         0.00      16224       1848
sda2              2.22         0.20        38.52    1931938  373499024
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>I gathered all the text files into a single directory, and ran a loop in zsh to create a csv file, ready for easy manipulation in any number of programs.
{% highlight bash %}
for each in <code>ls</code>
egrep -A 1 '(Time)|(avg-cpu)' $each |sed s/Time\:\ //g | grep -v '--\|avg-cpu' | paste -s -d '\ \n' - - | sed 's/( ){1,}/,/g' &gt; $each.csv
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>I always start building long lines like this one section at a time. Each section is separated by a pipe, (<code>|</code>), so the first section in the loop calls egrep.</p>
<p>{% highlight bash %}
egrep -A 1 '(Time)|(avg-cpu)' $each
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>This command alone give us output that looks like this:</p>
<p>{% highlight bash %}
Time: 00:03:39
avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle
           0.20    0.00    0.10    0.00    0.00   99.70
--
Time: 00:03:44
avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle
           0.10    0.00    0.20    0.00    0.00   99.70
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>The "-A" flag on the egrep command tells egrep to get both the matching line in the text and the line directly below it. The section between the single tics, searches for either "Time" or "avg-cpu". This gives me the time and the CPU statistics I'm interested in. Next, I pipe this output to the next section, a <a href="http://man.cx/sed">sed</a> command that strips out the "Time" string, so our command now looks like:</p>
<p>{% highlight bash %}</p>
<p>egrep -A 1 '(Time)|(avg-cpu)' iostat.ba-rec1  |sed s/Time\:\ //g 
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>And gives us output like:</p>
<p>{% highlight bash %}</p>
<p>00:04:14
avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle
           0.00    0.00    0.10    0.00    0.00   99.90
--
00:04:19
avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle
           0.40    0.00    0.30    0.00    0.00   99.30
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>The next section uses grep with the "-v" flag, which tells grep to reverse it's normal behavior and only return the strings that do <em>not</em> match the search text. 
{% highlight bash %}
egrep -A 1 '(Time)|(avg-cpu)' iostat.ba-rec1  |sed s/Time\:\ //g | grep -v '--\|avg-cpu'
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>The grep command is looking for either "avg-cpu" or two dashes and removing both lines, giving us:
{% highlight bash %}</p>
<p>00:04:14
           0.00    0.00    0.10    0.00    0.00   99.90
00:04:19
           0.40    0.00    0.30    0.00    0.00   99.30
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>This is looking much better, but the lines of text are offset from what I need them to be. A post I read recently by <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/11/two-simple-things/">Dr. Drang</a> reminded me of <a href="http://man.cx/paste">paste</a>, which is perfect for this job:</p>
<p>{% highlight bash %}
egrep -A 1 '(Time)|(avg-cpu)' iostat.ba-rec1  |sed s/Time\:\ //g | grep -v '--\|avg-cpu' | paste -s -d '\ \n' - - 
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Which puts everything on the same line, nice and clean:</p>
<p>{% highlight bash %}
00:04:14            0.00    0.00    0.10    0.00    0.00   99.90
00:04:19            0.40    0.00    0.30    0.00    0.00   99.30
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Only thing left now is to clean up the excess spaces a bit and separate each column by commas, another job for sed, which is only slightly modified from this post on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9953448/how-to-remove-all-white-spaces-from-a-given-text-file">StackOverflow</a>, which leads us to the final command:</p>
<p>{% highlight bash %}
egrep -A 1 '(Time)|(avg-cpu)' iostat.ba-rec1  |sed s/Time\:\ //g | grep -v '--\|avg-cpu' | paste -s -d '\ \n' - - | sed 's/( ){1,}/,/g'
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Which I redirect the output of to a text file, one per server, just like the input from the loop. This, finally, gives us the csv output we were looking for:</p>
<p>{% highlight bash %}
00:04:14,0.00,0.00,0.10,0.00,0.00,99.90
00:04:19,0.40,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.00,99.30
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Now it is ready.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2014-01-12-A_Different_Vision_of_the_Future.html'>A Different Vision of the Future</a></h2>
<p>I ran across a <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-world-population-increasingly-urban/">few</a> <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669244/by-2050-70-of-the-worlds-population-will-be-urban-is-that-a-good-thing">articles</a> in the past week or so that predict the majority of the population will be living in cities by 2050.[^1] I don't dispute the projection, these people generally know what they are talking about, but I would like to do a bit of daydreaming of my own. I can envision a world of small towns populated by remote workers and independent service providers, communities with relationships that are closer, deeper, and happier than their city dwelling counterparts. </p>
<p>I read <a href="https://37signals.com/remote/">Remote</a> by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson last month. The book struck a chord with me because I live 40 miles from where I work. I make the drive every day, except when weather prevents me or I've made other arrangements. I have the opportunity to work remotely from time to time, but it is not every day. The team at 37 Signals is mostly remote, and detail in the book how more businesses could benefit from adopting a culture that supports remote work. Fast Internet access, video conferencing technologies, and collaborative software have made remote work not only possible, but beneficial. Richard Branson says that <a href="http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/one-day-offices-will-be-a-thing-of-the-past">One day offices will be a thing of the past</a>. I agree. In fact, I think remote work could transform modern businesses, and in turn, our culture.</p>
<p>If most knowledge workers worked remotely, and could choose where they lived and who they spent their time with, I imagine that many, like me, would choose to live in smaller communities. The cost of living is less in small towns, the people are generally polite, and crimes are few and far between. If there are groups of remote workers in small towns, than they and their families could support a secondary economy of service workers. Grocery stores, bakers, butchers, barbers, small restaurants and cafés, plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and all the other services that are needed by groups of people. A community of entrepreneurs, similar to the villages that were common in the western world before the industrial revolution. </p>
<p>Big box stores can be replaced by Amazon and other online retailers. If you need a lamp, order it from Amazon. Batteries? Amazon. I generally do this now. I understand that the goods must come from somewhere, and that there will still be factory work, and that the factories will most likely be in the cities, but in my vision of a sustainable small-town future, our needs for factory made goods would be far less than what it is today. This brings me to the third part of my vision, the <a href="http://makezine.com/2013/06/03/why-the-maker-movement-is-here-to-stay/">Maker Movement</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We think of movements as the organized action of a group of people following a common ideological or cultural path. The DIY and Maker Movements certainly fit that description. They are filled with people who want to figure out how to make or do stuff on their own, rather than purchasing pre-packaged goods or services. Are the two movements different things? I don’t think so. I think they’re two circles on a Venn diagram that overlap almost completely. Perhaps there’s a bit more art and design in the Maker Movement circle (what we might call the “Burning Man Influence”), and a bit more changing-your-car’s-oil-in-the-driveway in the DIY circle, but otherwise the passions for creating, building, and sharing are the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creating, building, and sharing is at the core of this vision of mine. Knowledge workers can bring in money to small town economies, service work builds the core of the village soul, and makers reduce the amount of factory-built <em>junk</em> we need. Makers can sell their work locally or remotely via services like <a href="http://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a>, or just set up their own stores with <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/tour/shops">Squarespace</a>.</p>
<p>What will make the system workable is transportation of goods. We need truckers, or, maybe even trains. Research into automotive efficiency will continue and work its way more and more into the big trucks. I imagine something like a general store being responsible for the import and export of goods and, more importantly, raw materials to the small town. Raw materials could be used by the makers of the town to build what they need, strengthening the core talents of the citizens, building self reliance, trust, respect, and <em>community</em>. </p>
<p>Like I said, this is a daydream, but I don't think it is unreasonable. I'm optimistic about the future, and I don't think it needs to involve stuffing seven billion people into super cities, packing them like sardines in a tin. There are other options, better options, and it is up to us to make them come true. </p>
<p>[^1]: There are several others. Just do a search for "seven billion live in cities in 2050" for more.</p>

<p>I am a Christian. I believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that he became a man and was born to a virgin. Jesus lived a perfect, sinless life, and died on the cross as the ultimate sacrifice for all of humanity, for all time, past and future. He was raised from the dead three days later, spoke to his disciples, and now sits enthroned in glory in heaven at the right hand of the Father. Through Faith, I accept this truth, and I accept Jesus as my personal savior. </p>
<p>Through my faith, I am saved. This doesn't mean that everything always works out fine for me. It doesn't. I am going through the process of <em>sanctification</em>, an inner changing of who I am, my goals and priorities, the things that I once thought acceptable I no longer do. I will continue this process for the rest of my life, always with the goal of becoming a little more like Christ. It would be easy for someone to point at my past and say "he's no Christian, look at what he did", to which I would reply that thanks to the work of God in my life, I am no longer the same as I once was. </p>
<p>My goals in this life are to be the best husband, father, and follower of Christ I can be. Putting aside selfish ambition, I am to run the race set before me. I thank God for the will and the strength to do so.</p>

<p>The recent row over iA Writer's developers and their patent application reminded me what a small community the Mac developers are. The real problem was never about iA attempting to patent their work, the issue was that they forgot their place in the ecosystem. There are a few in the community that give freely and abundantly, like <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/">Brett Terpstra</a>, and when iA threatened to use their patents offensively against Terpstra's Marked, the community rightfully condemned them. </p>
<p>I haven't used Writer Pro, the application with the syntax highlighting at the center of the debate, but I do own a copy of Writer. I think Writer is a fine application; it's no Vim, but it does what it says and does it well. I imagine that Writer Pro is just as nice, and that the thought the developers have put into implementing syntax highlighting is well done. That they used a built-in Cocoa class to do it doesn't concern me, but attempting to patent the work of Apple does. It bothered quite a few developers too, but not nearly as much as if they would have kept their mouths shut and saved the patent for a rainy day, only pulling it out when the trolls came knocking. But they didn't. </p>
<p>Instead, they came out shooting:</p>

<p>The details around the issue have been well covered by <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/21/5234580/patent-pending-ias-militant-stance-on-syntax-control">The Verge</a>, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/12/26/information-architects-threaten-with-patents">Marco Arment</a>, and <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/12/isue/">Ben Brooks</a>, but I'm willing to ignore the patent. You can have your patents, even though I don't agree with them, and you can claim that an Apple innovation is your own, but when you threaten other independent developers, that crosses the line. I will no longer be supporting iA, best of luck. They should have remembered, we should all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7532GXPnO8">be excellent to each other</a>.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-12-27-Bigfoot_Footnotes_in_Jekyll.html'>Bigfoot Footnotes in Jekyll</a></h2>
<p>Like the <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/12/tweaking-bigfoot-footnotes/">good doctor</a>, I knew as soon as I saw <a href="http://www.bigfootjs.com">Bigfoot</a> that I would be adding it to this site. [^1] I've avoided footnotes up till now because the HTML formatting for them seemed far too <em>fiddley</em>, and the Jekyll Markdown processor I was using did not support them. </p>
<p>It turns out that adding support for footnotes in Markdown was as simple as replacing redcarpet with kramdown in the Jekyll configuration. Now, instead of mucking about with HTML that looks like this:</p>
<p>{% highlight HTML %}</p>
<pre><code>&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;
    &lt;a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;
</code></pre>
<div class="footnotes"><ol>
    <li class="footnote" id="fn:1">
        <p>footnote.<a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article"> ↩</a><p>
    </li>
</ol></div>

<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>I can have nicely formatted Markdown footnotes in my text, like this:</p>
<p>{% highlight markdown %}
Footnote inline [^1]</p>
<p>[^1]: The footnote text</p>
<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>It may not amount to much, bit I think it's a nice addition to the site. </p>

<p>As the year comes to an end it would be easy to look back and see all of the things that didn't work. Mistakes were made, endeavors failed, and it was generally a tough year. Some things that I thought would work out did not, and some things I thought I had more time before I had to deal with came due. Sometimes, when things aren't working out, it's best to burn it all to the ground and start over. </p>
<p>When I look closer, sifting through the ash, I find bits that survived. There are pieces of my life that <em>are</em> working, and that have not been getting the attention they deserved. I dreamed for years of starting my own business, being self-employed and working from home. The truth is, this is not the right time in my life for that. What my family needs is stability. The 9-5 works for us. Spending my weekends programming or studying for grad school does not. Farmdog had to go, so it was burned to the ground. What does work for me is writing. I've been very happy as a freelance writer, but I've been so distracted by competing goals that I've not given the endeavor the attention that it needs. Freelance writing after the kids are in bed works for us too. </p>
<p>For Christmas this year we got the boys some toy guns, and we had a great time battling it out throughout the house. We had a wonderful dinner with ham and corn and mashed potatoes, and spent a lot of quality time together. This worked, more than anything, spending time with the family <em>works</em>. I spent a long time over the past several weeks reassessing where I should go next in my professional life, but what I came up with is that where I am right now is where I need to be, and by focusing on what really matters, I can make where I am better than ever. </p>
<p>Sometimes you can see farmers burn their fields, so the nutrients in the crops will absorb back into the soil, making the next batch of crops stronger than before.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-11-27-Desktop_Setup_For_a_Sysadmin.html'>Desktop Setup For a Sysadmin</a></h2>
<p>My Mac is a finely tuned machine. I have been using a Mac for Unix systems administration work since 2006, starting with a PowerMac G4, and have developed a smooth and efficient workflow. Most of the important tools are open source, and the ones that are not are very high quality. </p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>One of the reasons I like buying Apple hardware is that it lasts. I run a four year old MacBook Pro, and so far have no reason to upgrade to a newer machine. I will probably upgrade to a solid-state drive sometime in the next few months, and expect to keep this Mac another two years. Last year I upgraded the RAM to 8GB, and that seems to work fine for me. </p>
<p><a href="/media/about_my_mac.png"><img src="/media/about_my_mac_thumb.png" /></a></p>
<p>The Mac spends most of its day in a Twelve South BookArc in the corner of my desk. I'm obsessive about  cables, so I have the Ethernet, power, time machine drive, headphones, and external monitor neatly Velcro'd under my desk and out of sight. I have tacks holding sections of Velcro under my desk to route the cables where they need to go. Work provides a 22-inch Acer display, which is not great, but acceptable for what I need to do. I would love a higher density display for text clarity, but I'll take what I can get. </p>
<p>I use the Apple aluminum bluetooth keyboard. I love it because it is small, has only the keys that I use, and is easy and fast to type on. I mostly agree with the reasons <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2012/4/30/keyboard-deathmatch.html">David Sparks</a> mentions in his keyboard review, but I haven't bothered to look into the noisy mechanical keyboards. Mostly because I work in an office environment, and the noise would bother my coworkers. I also use an Apple Magic Mouse my wife gave me for my birthday a couple years ago. The ergonomics of the mouse are not great, but since my hand is not on the mouse all day, that doesn't bother me. What I do love about it is being able to flick back and forth between full-screen applications, browse through Safari history, and double-two-finger-tap to bring up Mission Control. </p>
<p>Other than my iPhone, the only other hardware I use is a Western Digital drive I keep under my desk, secured with a lock, cables neatly wrapped in Velcro, as my Time Machine drive.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The first and most important piece of software I install is <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/10-14-2013/Quicksilver.html">Quicksilver</a>. Without Quicksilver, my machine is crippled. I map Quicksilver to ⌘Space, so the first preference I change is to disable both the "Show Spotlight search field" and "Show Spotlight window". I use Spotlight frequently, but when I need it I use the mouse and click on the menu bar icon. I install a few plugins for Quicksilver, but the most important are the <em>Remote Hosts Plugin</em>, the <em>User Interface Plugin</em>, the <em>Web Search Plugin</em>, and the <em>Clipboard Plugin</em>. </p>
<p>After Quicksilver is installed I feel at home, and I can start using the computer. Behind Quicksilver, the most used app on my Mac is the Terminal. I used iTerm 2 in the past, but Apple has continued to improve the built in Terminal app and I don't feel like I need it anymore, or at least don't see what value iTerm provides that Terminal does not. I use <a href="(http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro)">Anonymous Pro</a>, 14 point, and make my default window size 80 columns x 40 rows. Next, I install <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>, and from Homebrew install <a href="http://www.zsh.org">zsh</a>, and then <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a>. </p>
<p><a href="/media/terminal.png"><img src="/media/terminal_thumb.png" /></a></p>
<p>I was sold on zsh when I accidentally discovered that it would do tab auto-complete for directories on a different server over an ssh connection. I think I was typing something like:</p>
<p>~~~bash
    scp server.whatever:/~/somedir/
~~~</p>
<p>I hit tab out of habit, and it autocompleted the rest of the scp command. I sat there and thought about it for a few minutes, and realized that it must have known that I was typing an scp command, parsed the remainder of the command to get the server, checked for ssh auto-login with keys, and then parsed out the files available for autocomplete. There is also great stuff like batch file renaming with <a href="http://www.drbunsen.org/batch-file-renaming/">zmv</a>, and glob autocomplete for things like cd. Here’s another example, say I want to cd into a directory named “something-awesome”, I can type “cd awesom” and tab, and zsh will recognized I want to get into the “something-awesome” directory. </p>
<p>Speaking of SSH, the next thing to take care of is SSH keys. I always use SSH keys to log into servers without a password, and I recently generated a new SSH key pair. To do so, open up the Terminal and run <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa</code> and enter a password that is reasonably complex, but one that you can remember. The first time you use that key, OS X will prompt you to save your password in the system keychain, which I do. If my computer is compromised, whoever has it will have access to the unlocked key, but without being on our local company network it is of little use. The password keeps the key from being used if it is removed from my machine, so I feel it is a good compromise between usability and security. My public key is given to Puppet, and from there is added to my local user account on all the servers I manage. </p>
<p>Next I create a ~/Unix directory, and then ~/Unix/bin and ~/Unix/etc. Inside of ~/Unix/etc I put a plain text "servers" file that lists one server per line for each server that I manage. This list is important because I base a lot of my other scripts off of that list. It is the source of truth that I measure Nagios, Puppet, and any other tools we use that need to touch each server.</p>
<p>The first use of the servers list is a quick loop to populate my <em>~/.ssh/known_hosts</em> file. </p>
<p>~~~bash
    for each in <code>cat ~/Unix/etc/servers</code>; do
        ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no $each hostname
    done
~~~</p>
<p>Assuming Puppet has done its job and distributed the SSH key, this loop will touch each server in the list, add the key to the known_hosts file, and return the output of the "hostname" command to the terminal, along with a warning that it is doing so. Once the loop is finished, it's time for Quicksilver to work its magic. In the Quicksilver preferences, under the Catalog tab, and the Plugins option in the left-hand panel (whew), there should be a source option for "Remote Hosts". Clicking on the triangle will reveal the available sources, one of which will be our known_hosts file. Make sure that is selected and click the circular arrow button in the bottom right corner to rescan, and a number should appear. </p>
<p>This is how I manage getting to any server at a moments notice. I bring up Quicksilver, start typing the name of the server, and when I see the full name of the machine I hit return. Quicksilver launches Terminal with a SSH session open, and since I already have my key traded out, I'm logged right in. </p>
<p>There are times when Quicksilver isn't quite quick enough. When I need to make the exact same change to a group of servers, I use another tool installed through Homebrew: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/csshx/">csshX</a>. The csshX tool is a Cluster SSH implementation for OS X, and can drastically speed up common tasks. For example, when migrating from one NFS server to another, the NFS mounts are the same for every server, and each needs to be unmounted and remounted again. This would be a good job for Puppet, but for various reasons can not be. The csshX tool lets me open up several windows at once and type the same commands in each of them. It has saved me hours of repetitive, dull work. </p>
<p>Managing windows is not something I care to do, so I let <a href="http://manytricks.com/moom/">Moom</a> from Many Tricks do it for me. I have ⌘⎇1 mapped to move the current window to take up the left half of the screen, and ⌘⎇2 mapped for the right. I use this combination daily to split my screen between something I need to read and something I need to type. </p>
<p>I use Safari as my main browser, but there are a few internal tools that do not work correctly, like HP's "Onboard Administrator" and a couple of other tools that need Flash, like the web interface for VMware. So, in addition to Safari I also keep Firefox and Google Chrome handy. I don't bother doing any customization in either of the auxiliary browsers. I'm normally in and out of them quickly, and use them just long enough to accomplish the task at hand. For Safari, I use a handful of plugins which hint a bit more about my workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.verticalforest.com/youtube5-extension/">YouTube5</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dbergey.github.io">Invisible Status Bar</a></li>
<li>Type-To-Navigate</li>
<li>AdBlock</li>
<li>1Password</li>
<li>Clip to DEVONthink</li>
</ul>
<p>I set my homepage to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>, and set both new windows and new tabs to open with Top Sites. I also switch my preferred search engine to Yahoo and edit my <code>/etc/hosts</code> file to add this line:</p>
<p>~~~
    184.72.115.86 search.yahoo.com
~~~</p>
<p>When I open a new window or tab in Safari the Top Sites feature lets me choose to click on Nagios, Puppet, or our internal wiki, or just start typing to do a DuckDuckGo search. If I do a search, DuckDuckGo includes javascript that lets me use vi keybindings to navigate the search results. DuckDuckGo also includes a "bang" syntax that lets me search other sources, like man pages. </p>
<p>Once on a new page, the Type-To-Navigate plugin lets me type in the name of a link to highlight it, and I can press return to open it, or ⌘return to open it in the background. This lets me quickly search for and browse documentation outside of our local wiki. </p>
<p>When I find relevant, detailed documentation, I clip it into my technical database held in <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/devonthink-pro.html">DEVONthink Pro</a>. I quickly became frustrated with DEVONthink in the past when I misunderstood how it was meant to be used. DEVONthink is not an <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2009/09/yojimbo-and-anything-buckets/">anything bucket</a>, it is a specialized research tool meant to provide insight into your data. Once I read about how <a href="https://idlethink.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/on-devonthink-and-history-research-i/">historians</a> use DEVONthink the pieces began to click for me. I now drop all my technical documentation into DEVONthink, organized into a hierarchy similar to scientific classifications of species. CentOS is of the class Linux, which is of the class Unix, which is part of the class of Operating Systems, which falls under the top level class of Software. Also kept in DEVONthink is what software is installed on what server, and what hardware is associated with each server. This way I keep a deep, running database of the systems I'm responsible for, and synchronize the data to my phone for reference when I'm in the datacenter. DEVONthink keeps documentation that far exceeds the level of detail in our wiki.</p>
<p>Part of the documentation we keep are high-level network diagrams, organized by system. I draw the diagrams in <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a>, which I recently upgraded from version 4, originally purchased so long ago I forgot exactly when. OmniGraffle keeps getting better, and like the Mac, has a long shelf life. I export completed diagrams to PDF for inclusion in the documentation. </p>
<p>Finally, tasks and projects are handled in <a href="http://macsparky.com/omnifocus-screencasts/">OmniFocus</a>. Each system becomes a project, and each project has a list of tasks associated. A new recurring task for each project is to review and update the documentation semi-annually. In reality, the documentation is constantly in flux, but it is good to have a reminder to do an overall review to make sure we are where we need to be. </p>
<p>Over time my workflow has grown, and then condensed again, and finally settled into a workable, reproducible, long-term system. When I get into the groove, listening to old Grateful Dead bootlegs or Bob Marley in iTunes, I don't even notice the tools anymore. My system fades into the background, and all that is left is the thoughtful bliss of real productivity.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-11-11-Build-not-Buy.html'>Zen, Art, and Tools</a></h2>
<p>I've been a Mac user since returning to the states in 2003, but I've been a Unix user for a few years longer. Originally, I was drawn to the Mac because it was a fantastic interface on top of a solid BSD Unix core, but as I grew more familiar with the platform, I became more drawn to the level of attention to detail. The Mac is a quality machine, but today I'm writing this on a Dell running FreeBSD. </p>
<p>This Dell is absolutely not a quality machine. They've shoved a 10-key number pad next to the keyboard, and as a consequence have had to move both the keyboard and the trackpad off center. The Dell is heavy, like a cheap plastic tank. The keys on the keyboard are flimsy, and the display is terrible. In short, this Dell is the epitome of everything wrong with the PC industry as a whole; it embodies a lack of <em>caring</em>. The hardware is not my primary interest today. Tomorrow I will bring the laptop back to work, attach it to my external monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and will rarely, if ever, need to touch the computer. What interests me today is the software. </p>
<p>I'm using the <a href="http://www.pcbsd.org/">PC-BSD</a> variant of FreeBSD, with hardly anything installed but the <a href="http://xmonad.org/">Xmonad</a> tiling window manager. I have a few good fonts, and the excellent <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/">Solarized</a> color scheme installed, and have configured Firefox and the rest of the Xmonad environment to be as quick and responsive as possible. There is very little about this setup that exhibits friction, and what does has only a matter of time before I find a solution. It takes some work, but it is fast, efficient, and built on top of a core quality operating system, FreeBSD. </p>
<p>I installed PC-BSD because it supported installing into a ZFS formatted hard drive by default, and correctly loaded the Intel video driver for this piece of crap Dell. ZFS will ensure that any data that I save to the drive is protected from corruption, and will make it very easy to back up to another machine or hard drive. I also have support built in for <a href="http://ostatic.com/blog/considering-freebsd-jails">Jails</a>, which provides some interesting opportunities for local testing and development. The user interface for this new system is not nearly as intuitive or friendly as my Mac, but that's not the point of the system. It's not meant to be a cheap knock-off or even a competitor to the Mac, if the Mac is a BMW M5, as the car analogy goes, than this is a BMW R60/2. One doesn't buy and build an old motorcycle because they want an easy way to get back and forth to work. A car is far easier, a motorcycle needs special training, experience, and <em>maintenence</em>. </p>
<p>I'm finishing up the final chapters of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenence</a></strong>, and seeing how the tagline of this site is "a discussion on quality", I can't believe it has taken me this long to get to this book. ZAMM is <em>An Inquiry Into Values</em>, far, far deeper than I intend to go. The book was published in 1974, but has some amazingly relevant thought on our relationship with technology, especially computers, today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The result is rather typical of modern technology, an overall dullness of appearance so depressing that it must be overlaid with a vernier of "style" to make it acceptable. And that, to anyone who is sensitive to romantic Quality, just makes it all the worse. Now it's not just depressingly dull, it's also phony. Put the two together and you get a pretty accurate basic description of modern American technology: stylized cars and stylized outboard motors and stylized typewriters and stylized clothes. Stylized refrigerators filled with stylized food in stylized kitchens in stylized homes. Plastic stylized toys for stylized children, who at Christmas and birthdays are in style with their stylish parents. You have to be awfully stylish yourself not to get sick of it once in a while. It's the style that gets you; technological ugliness syruped over with romantic phoniness in an effort to produce beauty and profit by people who, though stylish, don't know where to start because no one has ever told them there's such a thing as Quality in this world, and it's real, not style. Quality isn't something you lay on top of subjects and objects like tinsel on a Christmas tree. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, when discussing his motorcycle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't think I'll ever sell it. No reason to, really. They're not like cars, with a body that rusts out in a few years. Keep them tuned and overhauled and they'll last as long as you do. Probably longer. Quality. It's carried us so far without trouble. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a second book that has fascinated me for the past year, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hand-Tools-Their-Ways-Workings/dp/0393322769">Hand Tools, Their Ways and Workings</a>, by Aldren A. Watson. The book is beautifully illustrated by the author, and explains in detail what hand tools a person should have, how they work, how to maintain them, and how to build new tools using the tools you already have. I'm planning a project to build a sturdy workbench that I hope will outlive me, and perhaps I will pass it on to my son, and I'm planning on doing it entirely with hand tools. Why hand tools? Why not power saws and cordless drills? Because the projects are not about getting them done, it is about the doing. It is about caring enough about what you do to take time and use your hands to do it. </p>
<p>Hand Tools, FreeBSD, motorcycles, Apple, these things are all connected somehow, and by following along this path, I'm hoping to sort out the connections in more detail. For now, it is enough to understand that the relationships between quality work, quality products, and caring enough to do something the hard way are all there, waiting to be explored. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-11-01-Go2_and_Paragraphs_Are_Now_Open_Source.html'>Go2 and Paragraphs Are Now Open Source</a></h2>
<p>I see no reason to keep the code for Go2 and Paragraphs to myself. I have no plans to continue developing them, have received no requests for support, and have seen very, very, few sales over the past few months. So, as of now, both <a href="https://github.com/jbuys/Go2">Go2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jbuys/Paragraphs">Paragraphs</a> are released as open source, under the MIT license, available on GitHub. </p>
<p>It is quite likely that there is a <em>ton</em> of bad code in there. Read through at your own risk.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-10-16-Avoiding_Complexity.html'>Avoiding Complexity</a></h2>
<p>I've noticed a tendency in my Mac setup to veer towards higher levels of complexity. In truth, I'd rather not use anything outside of the Apple provided ecosystem, but for one reason or another I'm constantly drawn to other apps and command line tools. It is a struggle to find balance between applications that actually enhance my productivity, and distractions that pull me away from the task I'm attempting to use my computer for. </p>
<p>The Mac comes preinstalled with just about everything you need, but not everything you might want. For example, Spotlight works well as an application launcher, but I install <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/10-14-2013/Quicksilver.html">Quicksilver</a> and use it instead. I've also adopted <a href="http://macsparky.com/paperless/">David Spark's Paperless</a> methodology for filing documents, and use both <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a> and <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> extensively. The keychain works fine for storing passwords, but I use <a href="https://agilebits.com/">1Password</a>, although that may <a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/preview/#icloud-keychain">change in the future</a>. </p>
<p>I use Microsoft Office for work, because, lets face it, sometimes you just need Office. I use OmniFocus to keep track of the big things in life that need done, although I could probably switch to Reminders. I use NVAlt for notes, but I could probably use the built in Notes app since I use it so infrequently. </p>
<p>There are a few other applications I have installed; Backblaze for additional backups, ScanSnap for scanning and OCR, <a href="http://hibariapp.com/">Hibari for Twitter</a>, ReadKit for news and long form reading. I use Caffeine to keep my Mac from going to sleep when I don't want it to, and Moom to provide better window management. I need Firefox because some web apps, especially older ones, do not work properly with Safari. VMware Fusion for a Windows XP machine I need for work, and instead of MacVim or TextEdit I'm using IA Writer for text. </p>
<p>Suddenly the number of applications I like to have running or available seems rather long, and I start wondering what I absolutely need and what I can live without. With a new version of OS X on the horizon, there may be a few of these that don't make the jump. </p>
<p>In college I used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> to get through math. While my classmates struggled with the Word equation editor, LaTeX worked wonderfully to create beautiful PDF documents with precise and accurate formulas. LaTeX was the right choice for that environment, but since leaving college I've struggled to find an appropriate use for it in my day to day work. Since I no longer have a need to create detailed mathematical reports, I haven't bothered to install the 4+ gigabyte MacTeX package. </p>
<p>I've used vim for many years, and have grown accustomed to the way it works, so much so that I adopted it as my main text editor for <a href="http://www.drbunsen.org/writing-in-vim/">writing prose</a> as well as code. Unfortunately, vim can be a <em>deep</em> rabbit hole. There is so much to learn, and it can be extended in so many ways, that it is tempting to spend hours upon hours perfecting my own special witches brew of settings and plugins. But, spending time like that isn't really getting anything accomplished. At the end of those hours I haven't written any words, only prepared my editor. MacVim as well has been left off the list of software I install. At least until I start spending serious time writing code again. </p>
<p>I've deliberately avoided installing <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>. Part of it is to avoid complexity, part of it is to keep from having a lot of "stuff" installed that I don't know if I need or not, and part of it is to try to stay out of the command line as much as possible. Even though I know it is there, I can also see a future where the command line is no longer available, and I'd like to not live in the past. The one exception to my avoidance of he command line is Jekyll, which I use to publish this site. </p>
<p>Because I know how to customize my computer, and because I know how to use the command line to install from source, the possibilities of what I <em>could</em> be doing at any given time on my Mac are endless. However, it is a matter of personal responsibility and self control to keep my Mac as clean, simple, and focused on the task at hand as possible.</p>

<p><a href="/media/qs_icon.png"><img class="center" src="/media/qs_icon.png" /></a></p>
<p>Quicksilver will change the way you use your computer. That is not a claim to make lightly, but after using Quicksilver on my Mac for the past eight years it is one that I can make in confidence. Learning Quicksilver can take some time, but the payoff is worth the effort. My goals here are to help you wrap your head around using an alternative input and interaction mechanism, to empower you to speed through mundane or repetitive tasks, and provide you the tools to stop <em>thinking</em> about your computer and start <em>using</em> it. Quicksilver is an application launcher, file browser, and much more.</p>
<p>I like to tell my kids that nothing worth doing is easy, and that every accomplishment is first a challenge. Like learning to ride a bike. When we first set out to ride a bike we are unsteady, off balance, and unsure of ourselves. We make mistakes in judgment and pedal too lightly or not at all, we hold on to the handlebars for dear life, mistakenly assuming that if we just hold on tight enough we wont fall and skin our knee again. But we do fall, and knees are skinned and elbows bruised... but we get back up and try again. One day Dad lets go of the bike, in spite of your pleading for him not to, and you roll on your own, you feel your balance, press on the pedals, pumping one leg and then another, suddenly sure, suddenly <em>getting it</em>. What seemed like a chore before is now exhilarating, you can fly like the wind! Once you've learned you can't go back, and you never forget. </p>
<p>The reason you can jump on a bike and start to ride long after you last got off is thanks to a type of memory commonly known as "muscle memory". It is the same reason you don't forget how to walk, or, more to the point, how to type. Using Quicksilver is like that; you use several parts of your brain at once, and interact using at least two senses, touch and sight. </p>
<p>Once actions become automatic, it frees higher thinking to allow you to focus on the bigger picture of why you need a certain task done. You want to open a TextEdit document so you can write out a grocery list; you do not want to stop to think about where the text editor application is, what it is named, or how to use it. Once you have TextEdit open, if you are an experienced typist, the words can drop straight from your mind onto the page because you know the <em>feel</em> of the keyboard, you know where the keys that make the words you need to type are, you can think at a high enough level to abstract away the need to "hunt and peck" for individual letters. </p>
<p>Steve Jobs once <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c">told a story</a> of a story he read in Scientific American that measured the efficiency of animals as they travelled a kilometer. What they found was that human beings rated about a third of the way down from the top, with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condor">Condor</a> rating first. Luckily, one of the researchers had the insight to measure a man on a bicycle, and found that the ratio of speed to energy converted was way higher than any other animal. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that's what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is… it's the most remarkable tool we've ever come up with, and it's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learning Quicksilver will make you faster and more efficient in your everyday tasks. It will free up time for your brain to work on much harder problems, and most importantly, it will make using your computer <em>fun</em> maybe for the first time. </p>
<p>You may not see yourself as a craftsman, but if you care enough about what you do to 1) use a Mac, and 2) be reading this post, I wager that you may be the type of person who cares deeply about the tools they use. Personally, I tend to gravitate towards a philosophy I like to call "<a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/04-03-2011/Principle_of_Least_Software.html">The Principle of Least Software</a>". The principle states that one should "use only the software that they absolutely need, no more, and no less." Using fewer applications, but knowing them better, tends to allow a person to uncover hidden functionality they didn't know existed, boosting productivity and making them a happier computer user. Part of being intimately familiar with your tools is understanding not only the how and the why, but also the <em>what</em>. So, while I'd like to dive right in to the how and why, first we should take a look at the history of Quicksilver. </p>
<p><em>History</em></p>
<p>Some history for the application can be found on its [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_(software)), but the section is quite brief. One interesting point is that the symbol for the Quicksilver icon, ☿,  comes from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_symbol">alchemical symbol</a> for mercury, which was once known as quicksilver. For years I wondered what that was. </p>
<p>Quicksilver began development in 2003, which is also the year I first bought a Mac. In 2004 Merlin Mann first posted about <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/04/quicksilver-append-to-a-text-file-from-anywhere">appending to a text file</a> with Quicksilver, and was followed by <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=quicksilver%20tutorial">tutorials and how-to articles</a> for years from several other sites, including <a href="http://gigaom.com/?s=quicksilver">The Apple Blog</a>, where I was once a contributor. Quicksilver was initially developed by Nicholas Jitkoff, known as Alcor, and distributed as freeware. Merlin did an <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/16/43f-interview-alcor-developer-of-quicksilver">interview with Alcor</a> in 2004, where he discussed the origins of Qucksilver.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quicksilver started out as a module based applescript for OS 9 using a healthy dose of <a href="http://www.akua.com/Software/AkuaSweets/">AKUA Sweets</a>. It basically supported drag and drop and performing of some basic actions and scripts on the dropped items or the finder selection. It launched stuff too, but was an unwieldy dialog of applications you had to sift through. The initial point of it was to speed up day to day tasks like emailing and file manipulation. It sometimes took longer to do stuff using it than by hand, but was mostly a fun toy. The idea behind it was sound, and that is what made it through to the OS X incarnation. The focus has not changed since the beginning, but the implementation has become far more flexible (though perhaps less reliable.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alcor did his best to keep Quicksilver current and add features as requested, but slowly he began to fall behind. When Alcor was hired by Google in 2006 or 2007 (I couldn't find an exact date), Quicksilver development slowed almost to a halt, and in November of 2006 the <a href="http://qsapp.com/quicksilverproject.php">source code was released</a>. </p>
<p>The future for Qucksilver looked bleak. Although it had been released as open source, no major progress was being made. Alcor gave an <a href="http://lifehacker.com/330548/quicksilvers-creator-on-the-future-of-qs">interview to Lifehacker</a> in December of 2007, where he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm inclined to encourage users to move over to the more stable and well supported alternatives like LaunchBar. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mac OS X moved on, bugs accumulated, and hope for the once amazing Quicksilver drifted away. </p>
<p>In 2010 a new group of developers adopted the stagnant Quicksilver code, bought a new domain (qsapp.com), and started the long, arduous task of breathing new life into the beloved app. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the early months of 2011, several developers worked vigorously to bring Quicksilver back to its former glory, and to what you see today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LoveQuicksilver site lists <a href="http://twitter.com/p_j_r">Patrick Robertson</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/RobMcBroom">Rob McBroom</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/lovequicksilver">Philip Dooher</a> as the primary contributors to the current iteration of the project. After years of work, Quicksilver today is stable, powerful, and continuously updated. It has once again gained the attention of <a href="http://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/14112/enabling-alfred-launchbar-quicksilver-and-other-app-launcher-integration">third party developers</a>. Alcor's creation has gained a second life, thanks to his foresight in releasing the code as open source. If he had kept it to himself, there is little doubt that Quicksilver would have completely fallen out of use by now. </p>
<p><em>Setup</em></p>
<p>Now that we understand a bit of how we got to where we are, let's get started. </p>
<p>Quicksilver can be downloaded from <a href="http://qsapp.com">qsapp.com</a>. Once downloaded, drag and drop to the Applications folder from the disk image just like any other Mac app. The first time Quicksilver is launched a wizard will run asking for some basic information and suggesting a few plugins to install. Accepting the defaults is fine, although I make one change, I always remove the hotkey for Spotlight from the System Preferences, and reassign "⌘ Space" to Quicksilver. </p>
<p>An aside. Quicksilver features are enabled through plugins, so you can choose which features you want and which you do not need. This also enables third party developers to add integration between Quicksilver and their app. I currently have 22 plugins installed (although the white bezel plugin I could do without).</p>
<p>Once the wizard is finished, you will be presented with the Quicksilver bezel. This is where you think about what you want to do. Write an email? Type "Mail", then press return. Browse the web? Type "Safari", then press return. Open your Documents folder? Type "Documents", then press return. Easy. You don't have to type the entire name of what you want to interact with, just type enough to recognize the icon, then press return. This is the most basic use of Quicksilver, but it barely scratches the surface of what it can do. </p>
<p>It is good to use the app like this for a while. Get comfortable with launching applications and browsing your files this way. Once you have ⌘ Space mapped in your mind to "doing something", it is time to explore a bit more of what it can do. </p>
<p>As I alluded to earlier, there have been many, many tutorials on how to setup and use Quicksilver. Most recently, a pair by App Storm:</p>

</ul>
<p>Pick and choose at will, most tutorials, even the old ones, are still valid. </p>
<p><em>Use</em></p>
<p>Quicksilver has become an integrated part of my workflow. I use it daily for: </p>
<ul>
<li>Opening SSH sessions to servers</li>
<li>Searching <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a></li>
<li>Searching Pinboard</li>
<li>Launching applications</li>
<li>Controlling iTunes</li>
<li>Finding buried menu items</li>
<li>Composing quick emails
and</li>
<li>Setting reminders</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a systems administrator during the day, so launching new secure shell sessions is something I do more times than I can count in the course of a day. I also search DuckDuckGo, often using the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html">bang syntax</a> to extend the search to other sites. When searching DuckDuckGo, I use the Vi keyboard bindings to navigation search results, which, nine times out of ten, means I never need to move my hands from the keyboard to find the information that I'm looking for from the time I decide I need to search till the time I close the browser. </p>
<p>In the keyboard preferences, I have the checkbox for "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys" checked. I then remap F7 - F12 to control iTunes forward, play/pause, next, and volume. I also use the main Quicksilver bezel to start playing playlists.</p>
<p>Quicksilver is deep; the more I use it the more of it's capabilities I use. My latest example is browsing Safari history and bookmarks using a slightly different setting in the Spacebar behavior. In Quicksilver preferences, the Preferences pane (yes, I know), and Command, the second section is labeled "Search", and the first option is "Spacebar behavior". I set the spacebar to "Show Item's Contents", which lets me pull up Safari, hit the spacebar twice, and start typing to search my history. I find this to be a better option that having Safari's history as part of the general catalog because I don't like having my initial search results being unnecessarily cluttered. </p>
<p>This trick doesn't just work with Safari; any application that keeps a history of documents, or includes a plugin, should work. </p>
<p>Understanding Quicksilver requires a bit of a change to your mental model of how you interact with your computer. The work is well worth the effort though, the payoff comes when you start calling Quicksilver without even thinking about it, flying through tasks that once slowed you down. It is like the difference in learning to type, where once you used to hunt and peck, and now your fingers simply know where to go. </p>
<p>It's also a bit like learning to ride a bike.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-10-12-Exciting_Night.html'>Exciting Night</a></h2>
<p>My wife and I were sitting at the dinner table chatting, winding down for the night, when I saw a pair of headlights shining in our back window. The back side of our house faces the middle school parking lot, with a good amount of lawn and trees between the edge of my land and the beginning of the gravel, so it is not <em>too</em> unusual to see cars back there, but late on a Saturday night did seem strange. </p>
<p>Then we saw a second pair of headlights, and the tell-tale red and blue flashing of police lights, followed by a third cop car with his lights flashing as well. At this point I figured they were going to give the first car a ticket for doing doughnuts or something in the parking lot. It happens, not normal, but not too terribly unusual. But, the cop cars didn't stop, they tore right through my back yard, driving through the ditch, onto the sidewalk that goes between our house and our neighbors, and out into the street in front.</p>
<p>One car stopped blocking the road, and the cop jumped out of his car, the second car drove around my neighbors house to his back yard. We saw the first cop yell "Stop! Get down on the ground, now!", and it looked like he had his gun drawn (although he might not have, it was dark), and we saw the guy they were chasing give up and lie face down on the ground. The second cop came from behind and handcuffed him and walked him back behind our neighbors house, presumably to the back of his police car. </p>
<p>The first cop turned out to be our local city police, and the second was a state trooper. The local policeman came to our house after a while to let us know what happened, and to take a look at the tire tracks to make sure that nothing was broken. Everything was fine, and I was happy that the kids didn't leave anything out that might have damaged the cars. </p>
<p>All in all, it was quite a bit of unexpected excitement! I was chatting with the policeman about what happened, and at one point I remarked "what a moron". The cop responded, "They don't normally get too many points for being smart".</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-09-16-Technical_Education_in_K-12.html'>Technical Education in K-12</a></h2>
<p>Our small school is nearing the end of the four-year cycle for a one-to-one program that provides all students in grades six through twelve with a white MacBook. Students are free to take the laptop home, and parents must sign an agreement to pay for any damages. Over the course of the past few years I have become strongly, almost vehemently opposed to the program. </p>
<p>Since my wife works at the school, they issued her a laptop as well. Issuing staff a computer seems reasonable, but with both Rhonda's and my personal computers, and the three from the school, we have five computers in our house. That just seems unnecessary, and our experience with the kids using the laptops has not been positive. </p>
<p>We have had to set limits on when and where the kids can use the computers, and of course, as soon as you set a limit on something you are causing friction. The kids would happily spend all day, and all night, with their nose in the computer. I understand that, believe me <em>I've been there</em>, but I worry about what spending so much time online will do to the kids. It would be one thing if the kids were doing something useful with that time, but no, they are not. They spend their time playing flash games, or chatting with other kids on Google Plus, or posting pictures of themselves making faces on Instagram, or just telling the world how bored they are. The students were given this amazing tool and set loose, but were not given the appropriate training on how to use it. Parents are given little say in how the computers are used. There is no administrative access for parents, but the computers are expected to be able to get online at home. Homework is regularly assigned that requires Internet access to complete. </p>
<p>One of the selling points the technology staff has used to sell the computers to the school board is iLife. iPhoto and iMovie are great, as recreational applications, but the kids could, and should, be learning so much more. The technology curriculum seems to center around learning their way around certain applications. My daughter might come home with an assignment to create a Keynote presentation, for example, but I'm not sure if even those skills will translate over to PowerPoint or any other presentation software. </p>
<p>The point is, without a core understanding of what a computer is and how it works, learning a single application becomes futile as soon as the applications user interface is updated. If the student memorizes where a button is to accomplish a task, and that button is moved, how will the student react? Neither the students or the teachers have a grasp on the rightful place of technology in our lives, what it really is, how it works, or how to effectively use it to get meaningful work done. Students are given Gmail accounts, taught how to trade personal information for "free" services, how to post embarrassing pictures of themselves online, and sent home with a $1000 toy. Problems ensue. </p>
<p>Students go into 6th grade knowing nothing about computers, no ability to type, no concept of basic applications, and are given a laptop and told to take it home and use it. My vision for a technical education is much different, and could start as early as kindergarten. There is no age limit for abstract thinking. One is never too young to understand that the pictures they see on the screen don't come from the screen, but from the computer attached to it. One should at least start learning the basic components of a computer: RAM, CPU, storage, keyboard, monitor, and mouse, before they are given one to play with. Some people think this is too advanced for elementary school, but I believe it is only considered "advanced" or complicated because they have never taken the time to learn it. </p>
<p>My vision for a technical education for "21st Century Skills":</p>
<ol>
<li>Teach the basics of what these tools are before they are given access to them.</li>
<li>Teach students to type</li>
<li>Teach students the basic hardware components of a computer and what they do.</li>
<li>Teach students what an operating system is, what applications are, and how they interact. </li>
</ol>
<p>Students could be issued an iPad Mini that would be their responsibility for the four years of high school, and then given the option to purchase the iPad from the school for a fair price. They could write reports using an inexpensive bluetooth keyboard and Pages or any of the many excellent text editors. But, the important thing would be that by the time they got to high school the students would already know how the device worked. In elementary, they could visit the computer lab occasionally, and be given instruction on typing and basic component recognition. In middle school they could continue to visit the computer labs, but be given more advanced training on past and current trends in common applications like office suites and web browsers. Speaking of web browsers, students should have a solid understanding by the time they enter high school of how the Internet works, what a web browser is and what it does, and possibly be given an optional track in HTML, CSS, and Javascript web development. By high school, before they are given an iPad, they should be able to explain how the web works, how a computer works, what an operating system is, what an application is, why there are system updates, and a basic overview of security and privacy. </p>
<p>Maybe that is asking for too much, but I don't think so. </p>
<p>In high school the students should be exposed to the Adobe creative tools like Photoshop and Illustrator, science classes could explore the basics of Unix, which underpins nearly every smart phone and web server on the planet. Math, design, art, science, music, history, and even PE can benefit from computers, but not if the computers are used to show pretty Keynote slides instead of diving deep into the topic. Computers should be used when what they can do exceeds what can be done without them. </p>
<p>Real education <em>can</em> be enhanced by technology, but only if it is used correctly, as a tool, not as an end unto itself. What we need are kids who learn how to <em>think</em>. We need kids who can solve some of the big problems that are going to be there when they enter the workforce.  </p>
<p>iPads lend themselves to this goal better than traditional computers. They are small, personal devices that are limited to one task at a time, much like how we think. We learn best when we are not distracted, and the myriad possibilities of what we <em>could</em> be doing at any given time on a Mac can be a load on our cognitive resources. iPads do not have that option, and as a dedicated research and report writing device they would work well. Think "electronic book, notebook, and infinite encyclopedia" all wrapped into one. Much like a book, the student can only do one task at a time, which allows them to focus. </p>
<p>I came home one day to find my daughter "doing homework", with her iPhone in one hand, music turned up in iTunes, a chat window open, and her math textbook and homework in her lap. She was getting frustrated that she did not understand the assignment. So, I asked her for her phone, closed the lid of the laptop and set them on the coffee table, and told her to concentrate. <em>Concentrate</em>. </p>
<p><em>Focus</em>. </p>
<p>I am more convinced then ever that our ability to concentrate is what will set us apart in the next generation of work.</p>
<p>Computers let our minds flutter about like birds, skimming across the water and jabbing at one thing and then another, but never diving deep into any one subject. It takes discipline to be able to resist launching Facebook or Twitter or Google chat, or tabbing over to iTunes or taking another break to check that "one little thing". Computers are fantastic devices, "bicycles for the mind", but we need training, and maturity, and understanding to be able to use them.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-09-10-For_The_Public_Good.html'>For The Public Good</a></h2>
<p>I just finished another article for <a href="http://ostatic.com/blog/the-internet-as-public-property">OStatic</a> where I imagine what web services would be good candidates for public, non-profit organizations. The two services I came up with are search and email, both I consider essential Internet tools. I've wondered about the democratization of the Internet before. <a href="http://ostatic.com/blog/one-server-per-person">One thought</a> I had was wondering about the possibility of each household owning their own "server", or server type device that connected them to the Internet, but also became <em>part</em> of the Internet. </p>
<p>The comments in the article about a server in each home mainly pointed to the fact that no one knows, wishes to know, or cares about how to configure a server properly, except for systems administrators. However, in my view that is an issue of design, not inherit complexity. A properly configured management system can build a server capable of picking up a few minor adjustments from a web form or a basic mobile application. What the server would need to know is what your domain is, or be able to assign you an address based on a default domain. </p>
<p>The concept is not without precedent. Connected Data's <a href="http://www.filetransporter.com">Transporter</a> is essentially an embedded server running on small hardware in an attractive case, accompanied by an easy to use configuration utility. The type of device I'm imagining would not need to be expensive either. A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Model-Revision-512MB/dp/B009SQQF9C/ref=sr_1_1/191-5831840-2652007?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378865332&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=raspberry+pi">Raspberry Pi</a> will set you back $40, accompany that device with a small flash drive and a case attractive enough to be in an average family living room and you have a home server.</p>
<p>The server would be capable of hosting a small web site, like this one, email, and possibly even connecting into a distributed social network like <a href="https://joindiaspora.com">Diaspora</a>. The device would provide many of the Internet services that a citizen of the global community could want. Now, to explore this thought experiment a bit more, what if the device was given away for free? It could be subsidized through local taxes, and organized by a non-profit. Given the right hardware the device could double as the family wireless router, firewall, and cable or DSL modem. </p>
<p>Assuming wide-scale adoption of such a device, we could expect large services to provide hosting for the bigger sites, but the need for lowest tier hosting services to decline. It is an interesting idea, but more of a thought experiment than anything.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-09-01-A_Daring_Adventure.html'>A Daring Adventure</a></h2>
<p><em>or, A Good Life</em></p>
<p>I've been floundering. I'll go ahead and call it an early "midlife crisis". For the past few years I have been drastically thrashing about, unsure of what I'm doing with my life. I went to grad school and earned a Masters in HCI. I joined a start-up, and then left it unexpectedly. I started my own business, shut it down, reopened it, and am now wondering what to do with it. I built software I no longer use myself. I write about open source software, and use a Mac on my desk, but Linux on my servers at the day job. I have a hard time concentrating on any one thing because I'm torn in so many different directions at once. Things need to change. </p>
<p><em>The Why</em></p>
<p>I once considered myself something of an adventurer. I left school before graduation and spent months camping in a tent on the Washington coast. I joined the Navy and travelled, visiting Spain, Portugal, France, Greece, Italy, and Israel. Shortly after my wife and I married we moved to England and rented a farmhouse in the countryside of Cornwall. We stayed there for four years, and in that time we honeymooned in Dublin over St. Patricks day, and I went rafting in Wales, and caving closer to home in Cornwall. I drove through London in an American Jeep. When my tour in England was up, I joined the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, once known as the Defense Nuclear Agency, in New Mexico in a special duty assignment. We used to travel to the deserts of Nevada, north of Las Vegas. In my free time I would take the kids hiking in the Sandia mountains. </p>
<p>Things changed when I left the Navy. We moved to Iowa, I got a job at a desk in a cubicle, we had our fourth child, and I started living a "normal" life. Day in, and day out. For the past six years I've been a Linux systems administrator. In the same position, in the same desk. I started to believe that my adventure was over, and that belief made me desperate. I was wrong; I've been traveling through the deep. </p>
<p>The "why" of Farmdog, my Mac software company, stems from my desire to escape the cubicle and build a sustainable income that I can run on my terms, from anywhere in the world. Farmdog was meant to be a way to facilitate more adventure, more travel, more life. I thought if I could earn enough with my software business, I could pay off my student loans and eventually quit my day job. The reality has been far less interesting. Farmdog has barely sold enough copies of either Paragraphs or Go2 to pay for the annual Mac developer account and the two icons I had done for Paragraphs. I've earned far more as a freelance writer than I have as a developer, which is a disappointment. </p>
<p>After spending months and months learning Cocoa and Objective-C, and months and months more after that developing Go2 and Paragraphs, I was crushed when sales dropped to nothing after launching Paragraphs over the summer. I called it off, shut it down, then felt that I'd reacted poorly so I brought everything back up again. I sent a friend, who's opinion I trust, an early version of this post, and he replied with a quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature... Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That of course is Helen Keller, who was nothing short of amazing. I've been mulling that quote over for the past several weeks, and in the last few days I've come to understand more about myself, my motivations, and where I want to go with my personal and professional life. </p>
<p>It came to me while jogging the other day. We've built a <em>good life</em> here. In this house, on this land. My family is together, my kids are well behaved and on their way to becoming confident, competent members of society. My faith has never been stronger, and our church is fantastic. My relationship with my wife has never been better. But, getting here hasn't been easy. The repetition of my daily life has allowed the kind of deep soul-searching that I don't think I would have done before. I've had to do a lot of deep digging, honest, bare-bones, white-knuckle type of digging. </p>
<p>I thought my adventures were over, but I've been digging through the deep. The biggest challenge a man can face is to master himself, only then can he face his greatest adventure: being a father and a husband. With the help of Christ, I am doing just that. My motivations behind Farmdog were to pay off debt so we could travel again. We will travel again, but at an appropriate time, perhaps when the seasons of life change again and our kids are leaving home to begin their own lives, their own adventures.  Now is not that time, now is time for slowing down as much as we can, enjoying and teaching our kids as much as we can, and living our day in and day out life to the best of our ability. </p>
<p><em>The Details</em> </p>
<p>Farmdog as a company is selling two products that I, personally, do not use. Go2 has been replaced by a Quicksilver plugin that reads my <code>.ssh/known_hosts</code> file. Paragraphs is a fairly good blogging platform, but it combines two tasks into one application, and winds up doing neither of them as good as competing products. Jekyll is fantastic, and includes free hosting with Github, and the Mac has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to fantastic text editors. MacVim, BBEdit, IA Writer, and Byword are at the top of that list. Paragraphs does have a few neat tricks, but it is nowhere near as good, or as bug free, as other text editors. </p>
<p>If I were to have the time over the next five years to dedicate several hours each week to developing Paragraphs, I think I could build it into a fantastic application. But, each minute I work on Paragraphs I'm taking a minute away from something else that needs done. If I'm programming, that means that I'm not doing any freelance writing, and as previously stated, writing makes me far more money each month than programming ever has. Since the goal is to pay off some bills, it seems counterproductive to spend my time working on something that makes little to no money.</p>
<p>I hate to take Paragraphs and Go2 down, but it seems hypocritical of me to keep them up for sale when I'm taking my personal and professional life in another direction. What makes this decision so hard is the amount of help I've had along the way. For years I've been able to send off a new build to a good friend or two and have them tear it apart, and send me back a long list of wrongs in need of repair. I cannot express how important having someone test your software honestly is, or how much I appreciate the help I've received. But, however highly I value it, loyalty to friends seems like a poor motivator for running a business. Luckily, since I have such smart friends, they already know this. </p>
<p>Farmdog will remain a business, and I will support Paragraphs and Go2 for one year from the date of the last purchase of either application, but further development will be very, very slow, if at all. I may keep developing Go2, but the future looks dim for Paragraphs. </p>
<p><em>Now, and Soon</em></p>
<p>My personal life needs me to keep working, but also to keep growing and finding new avenues for change. To find contentment in my professional life, and to solidify the many aspects of my work, I needed to find a new direction, one that met this criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Made use of my experience as a Linux sysadmin in a web environment</li>
<li>Made use of my degree in HCI.</li>
<li>Provided an opportunity for both freelance and corporate work.</li>
<li>Shows promise and sustainability for the future. </li>
<li>Incorporates open source software and a new stream of topics for writing, until freelance writing is no longer needed. </li>
</ol>
<p>Considering my professional needs, experience, education, and desires, it seems clear that I should be modifying Farmdog Co. into a web design and development business. </p>
<p>In many ways, this new direction reminds me of when I decided to learn Cocoa. Design now seems like programming did then: out of reach, too far from what I'm good at, just a little too much for me to grasp. I love a good challenge. Especially when that challenge can quite literally change my life. However, the difference is that I'm actually far more familiar with web work than I ever was with Cocoa. I started building web sites almost as soon as I got a computer. I was put in charge of building the command intranet back in 2000 - 2001, and I've been involved with the web since. Even with Cocoa, Paragraphs builds web sites, and I designed the default theme (such as it is) myself.</p>
<p>Web design and development <em>feels</em> right. After many nights of prayer and meditation, I feel good about this change. My first client will be, of course, Farmdog, followed by this site. I expect many slips and falls along the way, after all who am I to think that I can just decide one day to be a web designer. But I know one thing for sure, this will certainly be a daring adventure.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-06-06-Farmdog_Co._Sold.html'>Farmdog Closed</a></h2>
<p><em>Update: July 30, 2013 - Farmdog is not closed, but I am rethinking everything. Paragraphs will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future.</em></p>
<p>Farmdog Co. has closed. There had not been a single sale of Paragraphs for two weeks, and over three weeks since there was more than a single sale in a day. Farmdog was a fun project, but flawed in both concept and execution. </p>
<p>For anyone looking for similar functionality to Paragraphs, I highly recommend <a href="http://bywordapp.com">Byword 2.0</a> with Wordpress or <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com">Jekyll</a>. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-06-04-Where_We_Stand.html'>Where We Stand</a></h2>
<p>In the online help for Paragraphs, I have a rather odd statement:</p>
<p><em>Farmdog is made of dreams.</em></p>
<p>That comes from the heart. My company, Farmdog LLC, is made out of dreams. What if I could afford to move closer to our friends and church? What if I could quit the day job and rent out an office close enough that I could bike to work? What if my wife didn’t have to work? What if we didn’t have to worry about money and bills? Obviously, our life would be better. I was foolish with money for a very long time, and now that I’ve wizened up, I’m trying to put things right. Unfortunately, I’m not sure how well I’m doing.</p>
<p>Paragraphs was released earlier this month, and as I wrote on the company blog, I was very lucky to have been mentioned by a few high traffic sites. The initial publicity spawned a good start to sales, but it was simply not enough. I don’t have the budget for advertising, so word of mouth is the only publicity I can get, and without it, Paragraphs drifts off into mediocrity.</p>
<p><img alt="Sales figures" src="/media/Screen_Shot_2013-05-28_at_9.09.17_PM.png" /></p>
<p>That chart is disappointing, but it’s not the end of the world. I was watching a talk by Kevin Hoctor about building a good indie software business, and one slide absolutely resonated with me.</p>
<p><img alt="Never Give Up" src="/media/never_give_up.png" /></p>
<p>At one point, and I’m paraphrasing here, Kevin says “you can’t just ship your app and drop it after the first month when sales are not what you expected.” Quite true. I found another encouraging quote by Daniel Jalkut:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always remember that the main thing separating people who succeed from people who don’t is a commitment to keep trying while the others give up.</p>
<p>Knowledge and cleverness are key components to achieving your goals but they pale in comparison to persistence and an unwillingness to admit defeat.</p>
<p>What separates successful people from others is a commitment to keep trying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not known to be a quitter, and I’m not about to start now. If I can teach my kids anything by the example of my life, I want it to be about being persistent.</p>
<p>So, where we stand with Paragraphs and Farmdog Co. is that initial sales are disappointing, but I’ve learned quite a bit about what the market is looking for, and I’m working hard to address Paragraphs' shortcomings. However, given that I’m a father of four, I have a full time job, and I’m a freelance writer as well as a developer, there are a few very real constraints that I need to work within.</p>
<p>First, even as I plan for the future, I can’t ignore the fact that my kids are growing up right now. My oldest will be starting high school next year, and I’m teaching my youngest how to ride his bike. Each child needs one on one time with Dad, and all of my work will be wasted if I don’t make time to spend with them. We work so we can live, not the other way around. It is also important to spend time with my wife, fitting in little dates when we can, like a midnight pizza.</p>
<p>Second, even though I have big plans for Farmdog, during the day when I’m at work, I have to give 100% of my abilities to the company that pays the bills. Even when they frustrate me, even when I think I could build a better system on my own, and especially when I’m just not feeling up to it, I need to make sure that I’m taking care of the company that takes care of me and my family. Without the day job, not even the dream of Farmdog could exist. The someday in the future that I imagine is at the least five years away.</p>
<p>Third, I despise debt with a passion I can not put into words. The fact that I have debt gnaws at me, deep in my soul. So, to speed up paying it off, I’ve committed to freelance writing three nights a week, at least. Freelance writing is difficult, but it is good to keep that part of my brain in action, and it is great to keep up with the industry and the open source community in general. It would be easy to focus on the small section that we use at work, writing keeps me engaged and learning new things. Often I don’t feel that I completely understand a topic until I’ve written about it.</p>
<p>So, with all of these commitments, with my life in context, where does this leave Paragraphs? Again, where do we stand? I have to refocus from time to time on the dream. I did not start Farmdog to get rich, I started it to have more control over my life. That’s not something that is going to go away, the dream is here to stay, and, therefore, so is Farmdog. Practically, what this means right now is that work on Farmdog is relegated to the weekends, unless a customer sends in a bug that needs immediate attention. What this also means for Farmdog is that I get time to think through hard problems, and I get to bring a lot of experience to the product. This is why I believe Farmdog will eventually be successful. Paragraphs might not be perfect, but the feature set is well thought out and addressing a market segment that I believe is under-served.</p>
<p>It is my intention to make Paragraphs the easiest way to write online. I know there are a few geek hurdles to overcome, but I’m working on a lot of new things that are a bit outside my wheelhouse to get the product where it needs to be. I don’t want to go into detail, but suffice to say that by the time I’m done, I hope that Paragraphs will be the only thing a customer needs to publish their thoughts online.</p>
<p>So, where we stand with Paragraphs and Farmdog is that we plan on improving the product, slowly and deliberately over time, until we reach the dream. And then, maybe we will start working on version two. (just kidding, I already started on version two) Paragraphs is a labor of love, it will not be ignored, it will be lovingly nurtured.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-04-15-The_Hardware_Racket.html'>The Hardware Racket</a></h2>
<p>Every now and then something just gets to me, and for the past few weeks, that something has been the process of purchasing enterprise hardware. Servers, SANs, load balancers, the kind of equipment that, instead of a price and an "Add to Cart" link, comes with directions on who to call. </p>
<p>Most hardware is not purchased <em>directly</em> from the manufacturer. It's purchased through resellers, and each reseller will have a regional representative who will want to meet with you. The resellers don't really want to just sell you the hardware, they want to "partner" with you to "build a solution". They want to add consulting fees to your hardware purchase, and they want to jack up their margin on selling the hardware as much as possible. </p>
<p>It's not small money we are talking about either. I've seen purchases of a single piece of equipment drop by $22,000 by modifying a single software line item. How much of that cost was the actual price of the software, and how much of it was reseller markup we will never know. The reseller program is built to keep us in the dark. For example, NetApp has a few nice bullet points on their "<a href="http://www.netapp.com/us/partners/become-a-partner/resellers.aspx">Become a NetApp Partner</a>" page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The NetApp Partner Program for Resellers is designed to help you grow your business and maximize profitability. With NetApp® products and services in your portfolio, you can deliver innovative storage and data management solutions that satisfy even your most demanding customers.</p>
<p>As a NetApp Reseller, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase revenue</li>
<li>Earn greater returns on your investment</li>
<li>Leverage our tools, best practices, and technical experts</li>
<li>Create opportunities with our co-marketing resources, sales enablement programs, and prequalified leads</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of market momentum, increased demand for storage products, and innovative technology from NetApp makes this a great time to be a NetApp partner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pay special attention to "maximize profitability" and "increase revenue", because as a consumer of these goods, that's money out of your pocket. It's not that companies like NetApp don't have a price list, they do, it's just that the price goes through an algorithm first. I believe the algorithm takes into account the volume of sales by the reseller, the number of discounts available to the reseller, and probably a few other items. I'd love to get a look at it someday. </p>
<p>In fact, I'd love to see a centralize, crowd-created database of hardware costs. A Web site that let me check on what the going rate was on a 10TB SAN. I'm not sure if I could convince anyone to do it, but it would be fantastic if sysadmins and IT managers around the country would upload the PDF quotes they get from resellers. Then we could parse the quotes, and come up with a general idea of what the market price is for the equipment. Right now, we just have to trust that whatever regional reseller we are working with is being honest and not gouging us. Hard to do with the salesmen arrive in BMWs and talk about their private pilots license. </p>
<p>I've heard that it is "unethical" to share the quote we get from one reseller with another. I'm not sure about that. I believe that if the vendor knew that anything they gave to us had no expectation of privacy, we would be free to share the quote with whoever we choose. The resellers are the ones deciding the practice would be unethical because it would be bad for their business if they had to fairly compete on price. Personally, I would be satisfied with whichever reseller let me know up front what their cut of the deal was, and how I could calculate the most honest transaction for my company. Dealing with resellers is like trying to buy a used car or a gym membership. It's shady.</p>
<p>Here's another example of resellers behaving badly. We were in a meeting with a salesman, and an engineer from his company, and they had a manufacturer on a conference call to discuss the equipment we were pricing out. When we got to the end of the meeting and we thought we had all of our questions answered, we hung up on the manufacturer, and the resellers started undercutting their manufacturer "partner" to try to sell us a similar piece of equipment from another manufacturer. They said it was because they wanted to partner with us to make sure we got the best deal, but I was left with the impression that the equipment they tried to pitch simply gave them a fatter margin. </p>
<p>This is the biggest draw, in my opinion, for open source software and <a href="http://www.opencompute.org">hardware</a>. If we can match the performance of these big name vendors using hardware that we can purchase from NewEgg, we won't have to deal with slimy resellers.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-04-02-Mozilla_Turns_15.html'>Mozilla Turns 15</a></h2>
<p>Mozilla has been one of my favorite open source projects since I first learned of them back in 2002. I remember downloading the Mozilla browser, and thinking that it was just like Netscape Navigator (no surprise there), an all-in-one browser that threw in the kitchen sink, just in case you needed it. You can still download it's descendant, <a href="http://www.seamonkey-project.org/">SeaMonkey</a>. Not long after, I heard about another browser they were calling Phoenix, that, as it was explained to me, pulled out just the web browser from Mozilla, and left everything else alone. I downloaded it, and it was fantastic. Incredibly fast, lean, and simple. It became my favorite right away. There was only one release of Phoenix, after that the browser was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mozilla_Firefox">renamed briefly to Firebird</a>, and finally, Firefox. </p>
<p>It was an exciting time for the web. The world was starting to get broadband, but most connections were still dial-up. The slow connection speeds and slow computers meant that any small improvements in browsing meant a lot. To many people, the web <em>was</em> Internet Explorer. IE represented upwards of 90% of Internet traffic, so there was a real David and Goliath feel to Mozilla's snappy little browser. There were many sites that rendered correctly <em>only</em> in IE, and Microsoft was busily expanding their monopoly on desktop computers to the web with FrontPage and IIS. The web could have turned out very different, and I like to think that we have the openness and inclusion of the web today in thanks, at least in part, to the work done by Mozilla back in the late 1990's and early 2000's. </p>
<p>Over the years Firefox has both grown and waned in popularity, but the impact of Firefox, and how it helped shape the web should not be underestimated. Today we have several projects that work to keep the web an open platform (like the ubiquitous <a href="https://www.webkit.org/">WebKit</a> project), but the work is far from over. Privacy online is a major issue for the future, as big companies become more sophisticated about tracking your activities on the web, and despite the advances of Firefox and other browsers like Chrome and Opera, Internet Explorer still makes up for the lions share of web traffic. </p>
<p>I've used all (or, ok, most of) the different browsers out there, but returning to Firefox always feels like coming home to me. Firefox is different because Mozilla is different. They are a non-profit organization dedicated to making the web a better resource for everyone. In my book, that's something to be proud of. Mozilla is always looking for people who want to help, so if you feel like being part of something big, you might want to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/">check it out</a>.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-03-20-Scout_Beta_2.html'>Scout Beta 2</a></h2>
<p>So, quite a bit has changed in the past week or so. I got a lot of great feedback from a few beta testers, and stomped out a few bugs. A bigger deal though came from a couple of people who noted that they got confused in some of the views on how they were meant to proceed. Confusing the customer is absolutely the last thing I want to do with Scout, so I took off my developer hat and put on my HCI hat and tore Scout apart. </p>
<p>Scout now has a proper preferences window, just like every other Mac app. It comes up by hitting Command-Comma, goes away by hitting escape. Similarly, both the media manager and the theme chooser are in panels, keeping the main text editor view clean, and much less confusing about which view you are in, and how to get back to where you want to be. I've added a toolbar to the top of Scout, with a pair of buttons to switch between the text editor and the web preview. The other two buttons on the toolbar are to add a new post, and to show and hide the library of previous posts. </p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="/media/scout-beta-2.png" /></p>
<p>I've cleaned up the library view quite a bit too, and a added search field to the top which should come up with focus when you open the library. The search field searches both the title and the text of every post, so it should be able to find what you are looking for. The blue background was removed, and replaced by subtle dotted lines separating the posts on a white background. </p>
<p>I've also tweaked the image preview that comes up when you click an image link. The image is bigger now, and the background is more of a smokey white instead of the black it was before. I think this change makes the image more viewable, and makes the background fade out better, drawing attention to the image and away from itself. </p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="/media/image-preview.png" /></p>
<p>I've fixed a few things about the default text editor theme that bothered me (and John), making it easier to read and overall more pleasant, at least I think so. It looks especially good full screen. In fact, my opinion is that the full screen view is the best way to use Scout. </p>
<p>Finally, I've made a few tweaks to the data storage engine, fixing a bug that prevented publishing a site on the first run. Funny story about that. Last week I became a bit overconfident in Scout, and sent out invitations to try it to a group of well known writers that I respect. One of whom replied that he had downloaded and tried Scout, found a laundry list of things wrong with it, tried to publish to a folder, and Scout <em>crashed</em>. I was mortified. Turned out to be a stupid change that I had made, and obviously not tested thoroughly enough, right before sending out the application. I put the publishing code on a background thread to continue user interface responsiveness while Scout wrote out the files. <strong>Turns Out</strong>, that's not a good thing. However, what crashed the app on the background thread merely caused an error that Scout recovered from on the main thread, so finding the crash actually allowed me to find and fix a major bug. I just wish I had found it <em>before</em> sending it out. </p>
<p>Live and learn. Test harder next time. </p>
<p>With all of that being said, I really think that Scout is in much better condition now than it was a week ago. I'm excited.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-03-17-Updates_on_Farmdog,_Scout,_and_Go2.html'>Updates on Farmdog, Scout, and Go2</a></h2>
<p>Last week I sent in the certificate of organization to recreate Farmdog as an LLC in the state of Iowa. I have the <a href="http://farmdog.co">domain name</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/farmdogco">twitter account</a>, and a <a href="http://fdtest.site44.com">test site</a> built. Assuming everything goes through with the state without problem, Farmdog Co. will be ready to launch very soon. </p>
<p>Scout has a couple of rough edges to clean up before shipping, I need to finish the help doc for it, and fix a couple of odd user interface inconsistencies. But, for the most part, I think Scout is ready to ship. Narrowing the scope and number of features slotted for 1.0 was a big help. I'm planning on selling Scout through the Mac App Store, as well as on Farmdog.co using Fastspring. So, I still have some work to do on Sandboxing, as well as license keys and trial limitations. Probably a few days work to get all of that integrated and tested. </p>
<p>Which brings us to Go2, my professional bookmarking app. I'm rewriting Go2 from the ground up, and I'm pretty happy with how it is coming so far. </p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="/media/Screen_Shot_2013-03-17_at_7.11.44_PM.png" /></p>
<p>When the Mac App Store launched, Go2 was there on day one. It sold well the first month, but was downhill from there. Previously, Go2 had a bit of an identity crisis as it tried to find it's place. Was it a general bookmarking app like Delicious or Pinboard? Was it a replacement for Command-K in the Finder? When customers downloaded Go2, what were they expecting? As time went on and as I talked to other Go2 users, it became clear that they were using it similarly to how I use it, as a professional bookmarking tool for quick access to servers over SSH, FTP, or as web pages. So, the newest version of Go2 builds on these strengths, and makes it even easier to get to where you want to go. Here's a quick rundown of new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Importing the SSH known_hosts file.</li>
<li>Search field in the status bar now launches the first bookmark when the user hits the return key.</li>
<li>When you down arrow out of the search field, you can now use the forward slash key to return to the search field. </li>
<li>Overall improved look and feel</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, interactions with Go2 are normally through opening bookmarks. So, the main interface is now in the status bar, and new bookmarks will be added through the preferences pane. </p>
<p>Finally, I've abandoned core data as the storage engine for Go2, and am in the process of moving the plain text storage engine I wrote for Scout into Go2. Hopefully, this means that upgrades will be easier, and I should, finally, be able to sync through Dropbox or some other file syncing technology. This should make it easier for teams to use Go2 as their central source of truth for network servers. </p>
<p>Like I said, I'm excited about relaunching Farmdog. I've learned a lot over the years, and I can't wait to get rolling.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-03-13-More_Scout_Tips.html'>More Scout Tips</a></h2>
<p>Eventually I'm going to need to compile this into a proper help doc, but for now, documenting Scout with Scout will do. </p>
<p>Scout handles pages just a little differently than posts. New pages do not show up on the home page, and are not organized into subfolders based on date. Pages are converted into HTML and saved in the root of the site directory, right next to index.html. To create a page, add a new post, but before the title of the page add the characters <code>@@</code>. That is two "at" symbols followed by a space. For example: <code>@@ Contact</code>.</p>
<p>Secondly, the default theme that ships with Scout, the theme of this site, is my own creation that I've cobbled together over the past few years. What I hope to see are a few people more talented than I create some really great themes. In fact, assuming Scout is successful, I plan on hiring a designer to do just that. However, there are a number of hurdles to overcome before that happens. </p>
<p>To create a Scout theme, create a folder with the following files inside:</p>
<ul>
<li>atom.xml</li>
<li>atomTemplate.xml<ul>
<li>The two xml files are for creating the site RSS feed. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>base.css<ul>
<li>Should contain all of the site CSS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>default.html<ul>
<li>The standard HTML template for the site. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>indexTemplate.html<ul>
<li>Wraps each post in a div with an id of "posts". </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>post.html<ul>
<li>Creates the page template for each post</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>robots.txt<ul>
<li>Not currently used, but probably should be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>screenshot.png<ul>
<li>A nice screenshot of the post at 400x341 pixels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>toc.html<ul>
<li>The template for building the archive or table of contents. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Scattered throughout the files listed above are strings that look like: YYYY_SCOUT_SOMETHING_YYYY. These are the Scout "Y Codes", as in, "why are they so ugly?" I was looking for something that was unlikely to be reproduced anywhere else, and this was the first thing that came to mind. I currently have the following Y codes defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCOUT_5ATOMPOSTS</li>
<li>SCOUT_AUTHOR</li>
<li>SCOUT_CONTENT</li>
<li>SCOUT_CSS    </li>
<li>SCOUT_CURRENTDATE</li>
<li>SCOUT_CURRENTYEAR</li>
<li>SCOUT_POST_CONTENT</li>
<li>SCOUT_POST_DATE</li>
<li>SCOUT_POST_TITLE</li>
<li>SCOUT_POST_URL</li>
<li>SCOUT_SUBTITLE</li>
<li>SCOUT_TITLE</li>
<li>SCOUT_URL</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, the titles of the codes are self-explanitory, but as I have time I will be documenting them properly. For now, you can probably take a look at how the files in default.stemplate are arranged. Scout looks for these codes in the template and replaces them with the proper data from the posts to generate the site. </p>
<p>Lastly, you should never feel like you need to save your work in Scout. Scout automatically saves your work at various intervals. For example, whenever Scout looses focus as the main window, or whenever a new post is chosen, or when a new view is looked at, Scout automatically saves the current post as a plain text markdown file saved in <code>~/Library/Application Support/Scout/Posts/</code>. If you like you can watch the file being written to in the finder or as you use the application. Likewise, if you have a markdown file that you would like Scout to know about, you simply need to name it according to the naming convention of <code>YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SSSS##Title_Of_Post.markdown</code> and drop it into this directory. Next time Scout is restarted it will treat this file as its own. </p>
<p>Scout is intended to give you control over what you write without getting in your way about it. I know there are going to be some rough edges, but as we progress I'm sure they'll get worked out.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-03-12-Beta_Testing_Scout.html'>Beta Testing Scout</a></h2>
<p>Well, as much as I'd love to procrastinate for the rest of eternity, the time has come for Scout to take it's first baby steps out of it's private testing ground and out to a few interested folks who would be brave enough to beta test.</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="/media/scout_icon.png" /></p>
<p>I'm honestly very happy with how Scout is turning out so far. It seems very stable, and now that I've worked out a few annoying bugs it is as easy to use as I'd hoped. Here is a quick rundown of supported features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Markdown Editing -  Scout is built for Markdown.</li>
<li>Post Previews - The post is rendered into the chosen theme, so what you see in the preview should be exactly what you see when published online.  </li>
<li>Media Manager - A nice grid of the pictures Scout knows about.</li>
<li>In-line Image Preview - Speaking of images Scout knows about, dragging and dropping an image onto the text editor will create the markdown code for inserting the image in the post, and clicking on the text will show a pop-up preview of the image. </li>
<li>Themes - Scout supports a very easy theming model that I'm hoping will attract web designers.</li>
<li>Text Editor Themes - A few nice built-in themes. I generally use Solarized Light.</li>
<li>A Very Nice Full Screen Editor - Where I spend all my time in Scout. </li>
</ul>
<p>Since I'm shooting for 1.0 here, there are a couple of features that I've intentionally left out because they were simply not <em>there</em> yet. </p>
<p>For one, no syncing support just yet. I have the inner structure to support syncing over Dropbox, or any other form of file syncing, but in practice it is a bit janky, so it will not be supported in 1.0. </p>
<p>Secondly, Scout will only publish to a folder on your hard drive. It will not publish to the web. I'm working on integration with <a href="https://www.site44.com">Site44</a>, but as with syncing support, it's just not quite polished enough to include in the 1.0. With that being said, I'm hosting this site with Scout and Site44, I just choose the Site44 folder with the publish file picker. Works well, but could be smoother. Maybe that's a 1.1 or 1.2 enhancement. </p>
<p>Anyway, I would be grateful if you would beta test Scout for me. If you are interested, drop me a line on <a href="http://twitter.com/ibuys">twitter</a>. I'll get right back to you.</p>

<p><img src="/media/montana.jpg" /></p>
<p>My grandparents house was outside of town, at the foot of the mountains, surrounded by woods. Papa kept his guitar in a black case under his bed, along with his violin. Sometimes, after dinner, if we grandkids begged and pleaded enough, Papa would get his old guitar out and play us a few tunes. They were simple folk songs, sang without any of the southern drawl common in country music. One I remember the most was about his mama sending him to town to buy a <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/05-13-2009/jim-sanford.html">chocolate ice cream cone</a>. The little house would spring to life those nights, we would be warm from the fire, and full from Grandma's cooking, and listen to the simplest, most honest music I have ever heard. </p>
<p>Papa tried to teach me how to play, and I think if I had not been so young and stubborn I would have listened to him. He would tell me where to put my fingers, I would get it wrong, and he would grab my fingers and try to put them where they were supposed to go. It didn't work out, and so far I have only learned a few basic chords. Right now my guitar sits in the corner of my office, staring blankly at me through it's black case, waiting for me to bring it to life. </p>
<p>Sometimes a friend will come over who knows how to play, and I'm always amazed at how he can call such beautiful music from the strings of the guitar that I can only coax out a basic tune from. Years ago this friend and few other sailors who shared a place in Virgina would get together to write, play, and even try to sing. For now, learning to play guitar is still on my to-do list, but <em>appreciating</em> honest music has always been close to my heart. </p>
<p>The other day I was helping my daughter do the dishes, and we were taking turns picking songs to listen to while we washed. She would pick out one pop song after another, and as she did I realized that pop music hasn't changed in at least twenty years. It is still as synthetic and manufactured as ever, pandering to the lowest common denominator. I struggled to find something that we could both enjoy, but almost every song I chose was coldly marked as "weird". </p>
<p>She has a point, a lot of it is strange. Strange, and a bit raw, unprocessed, analog. I have, so far, 22 albums of the Grateful Dead, most of them live bootlegs from the seventies. There is something about the energy of the live shows, how I can close my eyes and almost be there. Sometimes you can hear the crowd yelling out asking for a song, the Dead hear it and when they start playing you can feel the energy spread through the crowd like wildfire, the beat of the drums matched by clapping hands. There was nothing scripted about these old shows, the Dead would just get up there and start playing. </p>
<p>This is real music, a person and an instrument coming together to create something beautiful. From Papa's strumming to the Dead's wall of sound, there runs in my musical preferences a common thread of musicianship, of jamming for the love of the song. I was browsing through the <a href="https://archive.org/details/GratefulDead">Archive's</a> library of Grateful Dead shows the other day when I saw mention of a Grateful Dead cover contest. That mention led me to YouTube, where I found one of the best covers of one of my favorite Dead songs:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/htSjip1UnZk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The Giving Tree Band had me captivated as soon as I heard the violin, but when the steel guitar and the piano started, I was <em>there</em>. It's not just the song, although it is a fantastic song, and it is not just that they have these instruments, the band appeals to me because it sounds sincere. It is hard (for me at least) to explain the difference in this recording and any other, but I think it has a lot to do with the lack of post processing. I believe I'm hearing the musicians real voice, not a digitized representation of it that's been leveled and artificially harmonized. I'm hearing the banjo, and the electric guitar as the musicians intend their instruments to be heard. </p>
<p>I love music, even if I would sometimes rather drive in silence. I like to listen to music that relates to me, that's played by people who might just drop by for a cup of coffee to catch up on old times. Music that makes me feel at home. Music that reminds me of the smell of burning pine, the taste of pumpkin pie fresh on my lips, the sound of Papa's guitar, and knowing deep in your heart that you are warm, safe, and loved.</p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2013-1-28-vim_power.html'>Vim Power</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51724787@N06/8424086311/" title="vim_icon by Jon Buys, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8466/8424086311_037e32dbcf_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="vim_icon"></a>No server, desktop, or laptop install is complete without Vim, and yet, there are times when I still see questions pop up on IRC about how to do basic editing of config files with vi. I remember, years ago, asking some of the same questions of an older Unix guru, and asking why I should bother learning such an eccentric and "outdated" text editor. His answer has stuck with me, he said "Because it is the only text editor guaranteed to be on every server, and some day you will need it, and have no other alternatives." Vim, short for "vi improved" is ubiquitous, but it is also so much more, and the time you spend learning it will be repaid to you tenfold in productivity. </p>
<p>Vim is designed to be run from the command line, without a mouse. To get around in a file, Vim uses three different "modes", where the same keys might do very different things, depending on which mode you are in. From my experience, this is the biggest obstacle of learning Vim, wrapping your head around what mode you are in, and how to navigate the text. </p>
<p>When you first launch Vim, you are in normal mode. Normal mode does not allow you to edit the text directly, but allows you to move the cursor around the text using the keyboard. The basics of what you need to know are:</p>
<ul>
<li>j - Move the cursor down one line</li>
<li>k - Move the cursor up one line</li>
<li>l - Move the cursor to the right one character</li>
<li>h - Move the cursor to the left one character</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have the cursor where you want it, you can press "i" to enter the next mode, "insert". Insert mode behaves more like other text editors, where the keys you press show up as text characters in the file. When you are done editing, you return to normal mode by pressing "Esc". This is a good start for getting used to how Vim works, and over time, those keys will become ingrained as muscle memory, you might find yourself inadvertently reaching for the escape key after typing in a web form.</p>
<p>Moving around one line or one character at a time is fine, but time consuming. What if you would like to move the cursor down five lines? In that case, you would enter "5j" in normal mode. What if you know exactly what line number you would like to jump to, say line 42? Enter "42G" in normal mode, and you will jump down to that line. Or, if you would like to jump straight to the end of the document, you could just enter "G" by itself. I do this quite a bit, jumping between "1G", the first line of the document, and "G", the last. If you would like to move 10 characters forward, you would enter "10l" in normal mode. Same to move back, "10h"</p>
<p>What if you just moved down ten lines, and would like to move down another ten lines? You could enter "10j" again, but it would be faster to use another Vim shortcut, the humble period. Hitting "." in normal mode <em>repeats the previous command</em>. So, whatever you did last, hitting "." will tell Vim to do it again. </p>
<p>Hitting "i" in insert mode will allow you to start inserting text, however, there are a few other options as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>a - Append, or, start adding text right after where the cursor is</li>
<li>o - Create a blank line on the line below the cursor, move the cursor to this line, and enter insert mode.</li>
<li>O - Same as above, but the new line goes above the cursor, not below</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have the basics of when and how to insert text, moving around the text becomes more important. Luckily, Vim knows text well, and has a few tricks here as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>w - Move the cursor ahead one word</li>
<li>b - Move the cursor back one word</li>
<li>( - Move the cursor back one sentence</li>
<li>) - Move the cursor forward one sentence</li>
</ul>
<p>What about copy and paste? Vim has that covered as well, but instead of "copying" text, you "yank" text with the "y" command. To yank the current line, which means to copy the current line, you press "yy". To paste the line, move the cursor to where you would like it and press "p" in normal mode. </p>
<p>So, now that you can fly around your text with ease, and insert new text at will, what are you going to do about the plethora of typos? A few more normal mode commands to commit to memory are:</p>
<ul>
<li>d - Delete one character, word, sentence, or the entire file if you like</li>
<li>r - Replace one character</li>
<li>R - Replace all the characters till you hit escape, just write right over them</li>
</ul>
<p>To use the delete command, you can either place the cursor over the text you would like to delete and press "d", or you position the cursor at the beginning of a string of characters you would like to delete, for example, to delete one word, you press "dw". To delete five words, you press "5dw". To delete a sentence , you press "d)". To delete the entire file, you could jump to the beginning of the file: "1G", and delete to the end: "dG". </p>
<p>And if you make a mistake? No problem, Vim keeps a detailed record so you can undo the last command with "u" in normal mode. </p>
<p>So, you can jump around the file, insert text, and delete text. How do you save the text? To do this, we need to enter a third mode, <em>command</em> mode. To enter command mode, you must first be in normal mode, and then press ":". You should see the cursor move to the very bottom of the window next to a colon, waiting for you. To save the file in the current working directory, you would enter:</p>
<pre><code>:w FileName.txt
</code></pre>
<p>If your file already has a name, then simply entering ":w" will work. </p>
<p>That's most of what you need to know to become proficient with Vim, but of course, there is so much more. I've barely scratched the surface of what Vim can do on its own, not to mention Vim's vibrant community of users and developers who have extended Vim through plugins. It is through the plugins that some real magic can start happening. However, to avoid asking on IRC how to edit a text file, this should have you covered. Finally, when you are finished editing, jump into command mode and enter "wq!".</p>

<p>You get good at something by doing it repeatedly. I've been writing on this site for six years now, but with little direction or topic. I've gotten good at <em>not</em> making anything of the site, which is not where I wanted to be when I wrote about why I kept this site <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/08-21-2011/Writing_Online.html">in 2011</a>. I've not kept to a regular schedule, or a common theme, so I am not surprised to see that the only traffic I have going to the site is my own, and a few that found the site from Google. The preceding statement will make the next seem a bit ridiculous, but bear with me. </p>
<p>I'm starting a weekly sponsorship program for the site. When you sponsor a week of posts on jb, your product post will appear in the main feed three times, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Your product or service will also be mentioned in the site header for the week. Sponsoring jb will expose your product to a small, but growing, audience of creative and technical professionals. Consider this your opportunity to "get in on the ground floor". </p>
<p>I have, for the past six years, been practicing finding my voice, my interests, and honing my writing style. I have also been deciding on the topics that interest me, that I'm passionate enough to write about, and that I care enough to share with the world. This is a site about <em>quality</em>, quality in our things, how we choose them, what we decide to accept into our lives, and what we spend our time on. I want to shine a light on the goods and services that I find <em>exceptional</em>. </p>
<p>I am also putting up some barriers to what I will write about here. I will not write about systems administration topics, or anything dealing with the general topic of open source software. I already have a <a href="http://ostatic.com">venue</a> for those topics, so they are out of scope here. If an open source application that I use is outstanding in some way or another, I might cover it here, but not on the merits of it being open source. Personal and family subjects have been mostly taboo since I started, and will remain so now. I will also not talk about politics or religion. These barriers are mostly to keep myself on track. </p>
<p>This is also a site about the pursuit of excellence in all that we do. This site is about using things that are worth having, and spending our time building things that are worth selling. The previous years were a warm up, the main game starts now, this is a great place to start reading.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-01-21-Cutting_Corners.html'>Cutting Corners</a></h2>
<p>After reading the MacSparky piece on craftsmanship, I'm reminded of how I like to look at my career as a <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/05-14-2008/the-master-craftsman.html">systems administrator</a>. I find that there are times when things that are not quite right just <em>bother</em> me. Like when there are inconsistencies or one-offs scattered throughout the environment I am responsible for. There may well be perfectly logical reasons why some systems are monitored and some are not, why some are registered with configuration management and others are not, but in my mind it is these little inconsistencies that add up and make your work look sloppy.</p>
<p>A craftsman is not sloppy. They are careful, competent, precise, and thorough. It is knowing that the little details matter, if to no one else but you, the accumulation of details is what defines the quality of your craft. It is knowing what the right tool for the job is, it is knowing when to use the power tools, and when to do it by hand. It is knowing that every corner you cut will come back to you in the end. </p>
<p>Cutting corners is unacceptable for a professional sysadmin. It doesn't matter if you consider yourself "devops" or an old school neckbeard, you must decide to do the right thing and make sure that all of your bases are covered. I like to think of the environment like the internal workings of a clock. There are lots of tiny little gears, but when they all work together, you can feel the system ticking happily along. </p>
<p>Your profession matters less than how you approach your work. Do you do it sloppily, haphazardly, or as a craftsman?</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-01-19-Misunderstanding_NSString.html'>Misunderstanding NSString</a></h2>
<p>So, while I was debugging the first post using Scout, I found an oddity in NSString. I was building the links between the posts using <code>stringByAppendingPathComponent</code>, to join the site's base URL with the path component of the individual post.  Unfortunately, that method seems to be stripping one of the forward slashes off of the <code>http://</code> string, which screws up building links. </p>
<p>To test it, I created a blank Xcode project, and added this method to the App Delegate:</p>
<pre><code>-(void)awakeFromNib
{
NSString *first = @"http://first";
NSString *second = @"second/part.html";
NSLog(@"first + second = %@", [first stringByAppendingPathComponent:second]);
}
</code></pre>
<p>And, sure enough, here is the output from that method:</p>
<pre><code>2013-01-03 19:26:02.388 NSStringTester[39861:303] first + second = http:/first/second/part.html
</code></pre>
<p>A quick search through Scout's source files shows that I'm using <code>stringByAppendingPathComponent</code> 53 times. Looks like I've got some work to do. </p>
<p>Also, this is a good time to point out that when you are doing web development, it is very important to test with multiple browsers. Safari hid the problem, Firefox did not.</p>
<p>Finally, it turns out that this is not actually a bug in NSString, but a bug in my understanding of this method.  My thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyohe/status/287009148665733120">Matt Yohe</a> who was kind enough to point out my mistake on Twitter. </p>
<div class="bbpBox" id="t287009148665733120">

<span class="twContent"><a href="http://twitter.com/ibuys">@ibuys</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/eridius">@eridius</a> also: “Note that this method only works with file paths (not, for example, string representations of URLs).”</span><span class="twMeta"><br /><span class="twDecoration">&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="twRealName">Matt Yohe</span><span class="twDecoration"> (</span><a href="http://twitter.com/mattyohe"><span class="twScreenName">@mattyohe</span></a><span class="twDecoration">) </span><a href="https://twitter.com/mattyohe/status/287009148665733120"><span class="twTimeStamp">Thu Jan 3 2013 7:34 PM CST</span></a><span class="twDecoration"></span></span>

</div>

<p>I'm still considering filing this as a bug, but I can see where they are coming from. Double slashes would not work for a file URL, but if they are already parsing the string for something like that, why not just check for "http" as well?</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-01-19-Scout_and_FTP_Scout_and_FTP.html'>Scout and FTP</a></h2>
<p>Building a desktop application that manages creating your site is great, but only publishing to a local folder is for the birds. After only a few posts using Scout, I can say that the process of publishing to a folder, switching to Terminal, and running rsync will not fly for any potential customers I may have. It's a pain. </p>
<p>However, the choices for publishing online like Scout is meant to are not great. The point of Scout is that you can publish to any bare-bones, $3-per-month web host in the world, and not have to worry about the site going down because of high PHP or database processing overhead. There is no database, and there is no active code being executed. The only thing you need for Scout to work is a web server to serve up the site, and an ftp server to get your site to the server. But, that means that I need to write the code for dealing with FTP, and probably SFTP. </p>
<p>This is going to be hard for a couple of reasons. There could be a thousand different implementations of FTP, and a virtually unlimited number of "edge" cases that I might run into. For example, just testing some FTP code with my current web host caused all of my FTP connections to the host to be denied for a few minutes, too many connections at once. I clearly still have a lot to learn about stream programming, but if there were ever anything I would like to use a library for, this is it. </p>
<p>Speaking of libraries, I've kind of got a thing about using external code, and I'm a bit conflicted about it. On one hand, I don't want to continuously reinvent the wheel, but on the other hand, I don't want to mindlessly drop someone's half-baked framework into my project. Choosing someone else's code to use must be done very carefully. Right now, I'm considering two things for networking, writing everything myself using CFNetwork, or building in support for libcurl. The libcurl library might be a better choice, since I could also use it for SFTP file transfers, but, it might also complicate my code, and add an external dependency. Tough call, still need to think it through. </p>
<p>In the mean time, another thing I've noticed Scout needs is a decent full screen mode. The current full screen mode just makes the window bigger, which is not really a lot of help. Full screen should vertically center the current text being edited, make the font bigger, and possibly make the text view a bit narrower than the full width of the screen. </p>
<p>Also, themes are coming along nicely. Scout will support a fairly simple development of themes for your site, in a little <code>theme.stemplate</code> package file. Double-click on the theme and Scout will import it, and it will show up as an available choice in the theme chooser. </p>
<p>Scout is by far my most ambitious project. Still tons to talk about, and lots of possibilities. Who knows, what about live statistics in the app? Beautiful PDF report generation? A Farmdog hosted option available with in-app subscription and zero configuration? It's all possible, all it takes is time. </p>
<p>Development continues.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-01-19-iTunes_Gets_A_Bad_Rap.html'>iTunes Gets A Bad Rap</a></h2>
<p>I've searched high and low for an alternative to iTunes, but I've yet to find a suitable replacement. I use iTunes for playing music, mainly over <a href="https://www.apple.com/airportexpress/#airplay">AirPlay</a> in my home office, and it works great. I've got smart playlists, star ratings, and an iTunes Match account to keep everything in sync between home, work, and mobile. Given my investment of time and money over the years, it's possible that I may be suffering from some type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy">sunk cost fallacy</a>, but honestly I really enjoy iTunes. </p>
<p>I've read several arguments against iTunes, and most of them make perfect sense. The application <em>does</em> try to do too much in a way very unlike most Apple designs, but I find it easy to ignore what I don't use. Most of what I've read centers around how bloated iTunes has become, but the performance counters I see tell me that it is not much, if any, heavier than comparable applications. I recently compared iTunes 11 to <a href="http://getsonora.com">Sonora</a> and <a href="http://www.tomahawk-player.org">Tomahawk</a> monitoring CPU utilization per process using Activity Monitor while the window was closed. </p>
<ul>
<li>Sonora <ul>
<li>3.1% CPU, 66.7MB - No Window</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tomahawk <ul>
<li>4.3% CPU, 82.6MB - No Window</li>
<li>Occasionally spikes to 91% CPU use, not sure why.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>iTunes 11   <ul>
<li>2.9% CPU, 94.5MB - No Window</li>
<li>2.9% CPU, 97.7MB - Mini Player Window</li>
<li>2.9% CPU, 97.8MB - Main Window</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, from what I can see, iTunes does use more RAM, but not by much. But it also uses less, or at least comparable CPU than the other two. I've done the same checks previously with different music players, and normally find similar results. With the feature set that iTunes has, I don't see a reason to go through the hassle of using anything else. </p>
<p>A few other people I follow on the web have stopped using iTunes in favor of web based streaming services like Spotify or Rdio. I haven't checked the resource use of the web players or the native clients of these services. I prefer to manage my music collection myself, and living out in the boondocks in the midwest, I don't like having to depend on my Internet connection when I want to listen to something. Also, I still haven't figured out where my bootlegged collection of Greatful Dead shows fits into a service like Rdio.</p>
<p>I still believe that Apple should split iTunes into <a href="http://gigaom.com/2009/11/06/iapps-the-software-suite-apple-should-create/">separate apps</a>, and I know that there are other people who's use of the app differs from mine significantly enough that they see problems with it. It just doesn't happen to me.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-01-19-iCloud_and_Core_Data.html'>iCloud and Core Data</a></h2>
<p>I inadvertently started a bit of a <a href="http://storify.com/Jury/the-trials-of-icloud">conversation</a> today when I complained about the state of NetNewsWire on Twitter. I've been a NetNewsWire user for years, and I was very surprised when it was sold to Black Pixel. My surprise turned to disappointment when the application was not updated, and now NetNewsWire has stopped working for me completely. </p>
<p>I have a group of feeds in a folder called "Read", which I keep as my must-read list. It just so happens that this list is the one that has stopped syncing with Google Reader. I recall there being conversation online about moving away from Google Reader, and how it being the only RSS syncing service was Not A Good Thing. From what I can gather, the new version of NetNewsWire was going to sync it's feeds using iCloud instead of Google Reader, a move that I would have welcomed. I keep a separate account used only for syncing my Google Reader feeds, so being able to get rid of that account would be great. Unfortunately, NetNewsWire uses core data as it's data storage back end, and development has hit enough significant problems with this setup that Black Pixel decided to work on something else instead. </p>
<p>Reminds me of another story, another once favorite app, Yojimbo. Bare Bones has been documenting their efforts with Yojimbo <a href="http://www.barebones.com/support/yojimbo/icloud.html">publicly</a>, and have had to push back releasing a new version that supports iCloud syncing several months. They had once promised that syncing would be implemented by the time MobileMe syncing was unavailable, but were unable to meet that promise. </p>
<p>Black Pixel and Bare Bones have some of the sharpest, and most experienced developers in the business working on these problems, and have not been able to come up with a shippable solution. In that light, I'm actually a bit glad that I didn't try to tackle iCloud syncing with Go2, and that I've settled on using plain text for storage in Scout. The plain text setup should allow me to build Dropbox (or any other comparable technology) syncing into Scout, although I'm not sure that it will be available in version 1.0. </p>
<p>The programming, it is hard.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-01-19-Footnotes_and_Other_Scripts.html'>Footnotes and Other Scripts</a></h2>
<p>I'd like a really simple way to insert footnotes in the text. However, I'm not sure how much of that I can do with the Markdown parser that I have now, which means inserting ugly HTML, which I'd really rather not have. I could do something in the generation of the site, inserting my own marker in the text and parsing through that later, but that seems like reinventing the wheel. Surely there are better ways to go about this. </p>
<p>I've also been thinking about other scripts or "plugins" for Scout. An early idea I had was to build in analytics, so you could download hit counts and other statistics from your host and Scout would build a nice report for you. Or, maybe even do some type of live updating, but I think that might be taking it a bit too far. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a> would be a nice addition, but I don't think it would be appropriate for everyone. Maybe a preference pane with optional plugins you could check and uncheck and have them included in your site. That way, if you want MathJax or Google Analytics or jQuery you'd just select them and hit publish. Still so far to go to get there.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the next thought, when is it enough for 1.0? I need to balance two weights; on one hand, I need to actually ship the app, but on the other hand, I want Scout to be <a href="http://www.marco.org/2010/07/04/great-since-day-one">great from day one</a>. What is it going to take for it to be great? What is the bare minimum that I <em>need</em> in 1.0 before I can ship it? These are the questions I'm asking myself.</p>
<p>One feature that I keep coming back to is the ability to have zero configuration publishing. For example, what if you don't have a web site or a domain name, but you'd just like to write and publish online in the easiest way possible? Scout should be able to grab your iCloud user name, have you click an in-app subscription, and let you publish to a Farmdog hosted server. That way, you can just download Scout and start writing, and Scout and Farmdog take care of all the little details. That's the dream anyway, but is that a 1.0 feature? Tough call. </p>
<p>Syncing is another thing that's going to be a tough call. I'm using plain text as the data storage, so I should be able to monitor changes in the filesystem and merge them into the application. Hopefully, building on plain text and integrating with Dropbox will allow me to (eventually) build an iOS companion to Scout. Scout on the iPad with Dropbox on the backend could be fantastic for writers. </p>
<p>If I only had 30 hours per day to work on this.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-01-19-Dogfood.html'>Dogfood</a></h2>
<p>I would like to introduce you to Scout, my desktop, baked blogging engine. I'd like to, but Scout is not quite ready yet, so I'm keeping him under wraps till I'm sure. There is only one way to be <em>really</em> sure, and that's to use Scout to publish my own blog, every day. </p>
<p>So, a little about Scout. I first got the idea a few years ago when I noticed <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. I built the previous version of this site on Jekyll, and used Github as my host. Jekyll works great, but it is very much a power users' tool. Anything that requires the user to pop open the terminal is not going to pass muster with the average Joe. However, I like the idea of a static blogging engine, and luckily, I'm <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs">not alone</a>. So, I set about trying to bring the power and control of Jekyll to a nice user interface. </p>
<p><img alt="Scout looks like a text editor" src="media/scout_user_interface.png" /></p>
<p>I'd like to say that I started working on it, worked on it steadily and consistently for a few years, and now it's almost done. Unfortunatly, I had a lapse of judgement where I was not properly backing up my laptop, and was also two months behind on my offsite version control, and wound up loosing months of work on the first version. I still haven't recovered completely from that, I wrote a Wordpress importer that I still need to recreate. After loosing so much work, I got discouraged and moved on to other things.</p>
<p>This Fall I decided to pick it back up again, and I've been working on it in every spare second that I have. I very excited about Scout, and can't wait till it's ready, but like they say, the devil is in the details, and I have to make sure this is done right. </p>
<p>Scout is heavily centered on the writing experience. The main interface is a plain text, markdown syntax highlighting editor, with built in preview, easy to build and customize themes, and a minimalist media manager.</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="media/scout_media_manager.png" /></p>
<p>Scout builds and publishes the entire site every time the site is exported. Once the site is uploaded to the web server, the server itself needs very little resources to serve up the site. There is no dynamic code to execute, which makes it very unlikely that the site will slow down or crash because of a high influx of traffic. </p>
<p>I'm using a single window for Scout, and the views fade in and out as needed. The list of previous posts is available on the left hand side of the window, but normally stays closed to concentrate on new writing. I'm also experimenting with the preferences view, trying to keep it very simple, beautiful, and functional. </p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="media/scout_prefs.png" /></p>
<p>I'd like to give a time table for Scout's availability, but it would probably be a bad idea. Even writing this brief post I've noticed a few things that either need fixing or need to be enhanced. So, I'll keep polishing, and polishing, and polishing, till Scout shines as much as I can make it. Then I'll call it 1.0, release it to the world, and start fixing everything that the world finds. </p>
<p>I will be writing more about Scout in the coming weeks, and would love to hear your thoughts on the concept. Feel free to drop me a <a href="/contact.html">line</a>.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2013-01-19-A_World_of_Things.html'>A World of Things</a></h2>
<p>It is very easy when living in the technology field to ignore the actual physical space we occupy. Skills once thought essential are slowly being forgotten as we move farther and farther away from a culture of being able to create and fix <em>things</em>. </p>
<p>We visited my wife's sister's family for Christmas this year. They have a beautiful thirteen acre wooded plot out in the country, and I savor our visits and the time that we get to spend there. My favorite times are standing outside listening to the quiet and watching the birds. On this particular occasion, we met in town before heading out to their place, and when we arrived my wife and I wondered if we beat them home. We didn't see the truck they were driving, so I got out to knock on the garage door. Jeff, my brother-in-law, was washing his truck in the garage, draining the water down two drains centered under the parking areas for two cars, and using the hot water tap. </p>
<p>I was more than a bit envious. His garage is heated, has several electrical outlets, hot and cold water taps, and drains. It is, in short, the perfect place to do a complete detailing of a vehicle in winter. Jeff greeted us warmly, and asked if I'd like to wash our van next. I could not turn down that offer, especially since we were just at a car wash that turned out to be closed. We finished his truck, pulled it out of the garage, and pulled the van in. Jeff walked me through a thorough deep-cleaning of the van, pulling out plastic bits to spray out the sand and junk that accumulates in the undercarriage, and explaining how certain parts of the frame are more prone to rust because of the lip. The van had never been so clean by the time we finished. He asked when the last time the van was waxed, which was probably before I bought it. We talked about the different kinds of waxes for a bit, and agreed to let the van dry in the garage and wax it in the morning.   </p>
<p>I slept in till eight, and by the time I got up, Jeff had already put the wax on the van and was waiting for it to dry. We worked together to finish the job, and he even got out his buffer to get some of the marks out of the doors. </p>
<p>Jeff is a park ranger, and over the years he's accumulated a collection of very practical skills focused on maintenance and preservation of things. It's an interest we share, and reminds me of my first few years in the Navy when I worked as a machinist. The main goal of the enlisted man in the Navy is the maintenance of the ship. That means everything from cleaning the toilets and sweeping the deck, to replacing broken bolts. It means working with your hands.</p>
<p>It wasn't too long ago when families made most of the things that they needed. At the least, the things they needed were made locally. Towns had to be somewhat self-sustaining or they would not survive. As more and more of our things started to come from factories, and the factories where the things were made were moved to far away lands, our need for creating things left, and with it the skills to do so. I was completely fascinated by this video posted by <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2012/12/damascus-steel-knife/">Shawn Blanc</a> of a blacksmith creating a knife, and then a leather worker building a beautiful sheath for the knife. Being a blacksmith would have been exhausting work, but I can only imagine the satisfaction at having built something like a knife out of pieces of steel. </p>
<p>There is no steel in programming. Only thought. We like to think that there is blood and sweat in our applications, but the truth is that there is only deep thought. Computers are tools; fascinating, engrossing tools, but still just tools. We should all pay as much attention to the rest of our possessions as we do to our computers. At least I should. I'm not one to make new year's resolutions, but in the coming year I am making it my goal to become less reliant on my computer, and to take better care of the things God has granted me.</p>

<p>Instead of looking back, I like to look forward. As a guide on how I'd like to live the next year of my life, here are Benjamin Franklin's famous 13 Virtues, written when he was 20:</p>
<ol>
<li>Temperance. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.</li>
<li>Silence. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.</li>
<li>Order. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.</li>
<li>Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.</li>
<li>Frugality. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.</li>
<li>Industry. Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.</li>
<li>Sincerity. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.</li>
<li>Justice. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.</li>
<li>Moderation. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.</li>
<li>Cleanliness. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.</li>
<li>Tranquillity. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.</li>
<li>Chastity. Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.</li>
<li>Humility. Imitate Jesus and Socrates.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the many things I love about this list is not how it says to do things, but how it says to avoid things. For example, "Avoid trifling conversation", "waste nothing", and "cut off all unnecessary actions". I think there is something for everyone in this list.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2012-12-20-No_More_Guns.html'>No More Guns</a></h2>
<p>I'm angry. You should be too. On December 14th, a young man shot his way into a locked elementary school in a small town in Connecticut and murdered twenty children and six adults. This is an abhorrent act by a mentally ill person, but the magnitude of the act was amplified because the murderer had access to guns. Big guns.  </p>
<h3>The Facts</h3>
<p>The gunman was carrying three weapons, a 9mm SIG handgun, a Glock 10mm Auto, and a Bushmaster M4 Type Carbine. Let's take a look. </p>
<p><em>9mm SIG</em></p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="/media/SIG_P210_IMG_6829-30.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>Glock 10mm Auto</em></p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="/media/Glock_10mm_Auto.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>Bushmaster M4 Type Carbine</em></p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="/media/Bushmaster_M4_Type_Carbine.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Bushmaster was the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/authorities-search-motives-elementary-school-shooting-massacre/story?id=17981351#.UNO84aXSLi4">primary weapon used in the attack</a>. Take a close look at that gun and ask yourself what the primary purpose of a device like that might be. This type of gun is not used for hunting. This is a military grade weapon, it's sole purpose in existence is to kill human beings. </p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>The other day I had the unfortunate privilege of watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expendables_2">The Expendables 2</a>. The movie is not good, but it's appeal to a certain group of people is understandable. Lots of violence, big action stars from the 80's together in one movie to spew horrible one-liners off of each other. It's 103 minutes of senseless violence, glorifying in how many bad guys the good guys can kill before reloading. It is a movie made for men who never outgrew their adolescent worship of Rambo. A movie that caters to the American desire to be seen as a "bad-ass". </p>
<p>Someone you don't want to mess with, someone who would rip your head off, someone who dresses all in black because that's what the lone wolf who fights for revenge does. "Whoaaaaa... Arnold and Stallone <strong>AND</strong> Bruce Willis in the same scene!" It's exploitation of hero worship. The show is designed to appeal to our base instincts, to get our adrenaline pumping, and to allow the viewer to vicariously wear the persona of a man who acts without conscience. A man who is not pushed around by anyone. </p>
<p>The Expendables is not responsible for the shooting in Connecticut, but it does serve as an example of the type of mindset that plagues the United States. The disregard for human life and general lack of empathy or caring glorified by The Expendables is not new. I've seen movies like this for my entire life, and the shows go back at least to the westerns of early cinema. Popular movies are just a mirror for exposing what we like. Americans are a violent and warlike people. Just because some of us wear a suit and tie to work doesn't mean that we don't carry that violence inside. We are not too far removed from Romans who would watch gladiators duel to the death in the Colosseum for sport. </p>
<p>Our culture of violence, and our deep embrace of guns as an expression of individual achievement and self-realization is a deep problem that is not going to go away any time soon. We make assault rifles available to the general public, but most states will still lock someone up for possession of an eighth ounce of marijuana. We have much work to do. </p>
<h3>Escalation</h3>
<p>The shooter arrived at the school wearing a bullet-proof vest, military style clothes, and a mask. He used the Bushmaster to shoot open the door, and then killed the first two people who tried to stop him. Our local school board addressed the security of our school at the monthly meeting, where a respected member of the community, a doctor no less, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no better deterrent than shooting back at someone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That depends. On several factors. In the case of the Connecticut incident, I'm not sure it would have mattered. It is very difficult to stop a determined gunman, especially one who has already made up his mind to take his own life. If a target is guarded, the first person you take out is the guard. If the guard is carrying a weapon, you make sure you have a counter-weapon, something big enough, fast enough, and powerful enough to win in a gunfight. </p>
<p>However, the real issue is not properly equipping the guard to deal with a siege. The issue is that the doctor's proposal recommends fighting the problem with more of the problem. It is the expendables answer. It is Rambo's answer. The problem is not that our schools are not better protected, the problem is that we have a culture that encourages violence, provides easy access to powerful weapons, and does not provide adequate treatment for mental illness. </p>
<h3>Guns</h3>
<p>Take a look at the Bushmaster in the image above again. Why do we want this in our world? Why does this weapon exist? The obvious answer is because there are bad people in the world that need to be dealt with. I agree, and I am so thankful for the military members who put their lives on the line to protect our way of life. But why outside of that context, outside of the group of people we have selected to deal with threats, the police, the military, why does the Bushmaster need to be made available to the general public? </p>
<p>If you privately own one of these weapons, why? </p>
<p>My favorite argument against tighter gun laws is that criminals do not obey the law, so they would have guns and law abiding citizens would not, leaving the good people at the mercy of the bad. It is a nice sentiment, but not one that holds up under scrutinization. In the imaginary situation where guns other than rifles for hunting were outlawed, where would a mentally ill person contemplating shooting up a kindergarten get his guns? From the mafia? From the local, small-town underground arms dealer?  I would assume that whatever pleasure is gained by owning a weapon like this would not be enough to offset the risk accepted by breaking the law to obtain the weapon. Therefore, assuming that the local police are doing their job, the weapons would not be available. </p>
<p>Besides, criminal access to weapons is a different problem than the one being addressed here. This is a problem of culture and availability. </p>
<p>The Second Amendment reads thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The right to bear arms so often called upon by gun enthusiasts is misused. The founders of our nation were saying that local governing bodies could organize a militia. I'm certain that the founders could not envision a Bushmaster, nor could they imagine a world where someone would use one to murder children. We live in a world unimaginable to the people who founded this country, so interpreting their wishes makes little sense. We need to decide for ourselves what is best for the current world we live in, and what is best for the immediate future. </p>
<p>My opinion is that the only gun a private citizen truly needs is a rifle for hunting. Would the massacre in Connecticut have happened if the only gun the killer could get his hands on was a single shot rifle? I don't think so.   </p>
<h3>Change</h3>
<p>We have a few things to work on, America. Let's put an end to glorifying senseless violence. Let's get the weapons who's only purpose is for us to more efficiently kill each other off the streets. Let's focus on getting people who need help the help they need. We are better than this, we can do better. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2012-12-07-The_Man_in_Full.html'>On Culture</a></h2>
<p>You never need to prove to anyone who you are. You simple are who you are. Claiming that someone else is faking their interest in a topic is ridiculous. Our interests and curiosities define us just as much as, if not more than, our histories and personal experiences. Friendly competition between peers on knowledge of the esoteric details of a given subject is good fun, but not a defining prerequisite for claiming curiosity about the subject. I would like to think that the previous few sentences are unnecessary in a conversation with adults, but unfortunately, as the recent conversations surrounding "fake geek girls" has shown, that is not the case. In a sad way, many of us have not matured past the social battleground of middle school. </p>
<p>I was not a geek in school, I didn't get into computers till I was in my twenties. I can not claim a long history of love of board games, I've only played D&amp;D once, and didn't get a lot out of it. I was never a gamer, but I liked Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers. I was never a jock, but I liked playing football. Despite our deep tribal instincts, I have never really belonged to any particular group with any depth. Not belonging did not mean not wanting to belong though. So, when I read Serenity Caldwell's post <a href="http://manyhats.tumblr.com/post/37410592164/fears-of-a-charlatan-girl">Fears of a Charlatan Girl</a> it struck a nerve. In it, she describes a fear that I remember:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But my biggest fear is ill-defined, murky, opaque. I can’t pack it into a pithy sentence. I can’t even clearly explain it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are more blog posts and conference talks and speeches than I can point to about this feeling—that you’re not worthy, you’re not an expert, you shouldn’t be talking, you shouldn’t be doing this job.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not know Serenity, but I think I may be able to define her fear, at least as I remember it. Rejection. It is the fear that lies in the gulf between who we are and who we aspire to be. We know we are not our perfect vision of ourselves, but it is in this aspiration that we grow to become the best we can be. God knows I'm still trying to bridge that gulf. God willing, I will never stop trying. </p>
<p>Reading about the drunken <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2012/11/nerds-stop-hating-women-please">rants</a> of someone who has not been able to get past whatever happened in his formative years, I can't help but think that, yes, he is wrong, but more importantly, why do we care? If you want to dress up as Captain Marvel and go to a convention, go for it. If you want to get on a podcast and talk about the books you are reading, I'd love to hear it. Fear of rejection, of being called out, keeps many of us from becoming the person we were meant to be. I'm still trying to get there. </p>
<pre><code>IF you can keep your head when all about you 
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings 
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!

<p>Kipling was a product of his time, but you can replace "Man" in that last line with "Grownup". </p>
<p>One last note on the apparent abundance of misogyny in geek culture. If you exclude someone from your social group based on what they are, what they look like, or some other measure outside of shared interests, how dare you. Shame on you. Stop it. (Oh, if only it were that easy.)</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2012-12-03-Quiet_Time.html'>Quiet Time</a></h2>
<p>The office is empty this morning. I just closed iTunes, and I am enjoying listening to my own thoughts. No music, no talking, no background, just quiet. Sitting in silence is a luxury these days, and one that should not be taken for granted. </p>
<p>When I was a kid I loved to find these quiet hidden spots. They were usually by water, but sometimes they would be a small clearing in the woods, or a smooth rock off of a gravel road that climbed above the forest. To find a favorite of mine, you would visit the local riverside park in our small town. From there you would walk along the shore to the edge of the park, climb under the brush and push your way through small trees that created a natural barrier concealing a small strip of land that jutted out into the river. To look at it from the outside you just saw the canopy of the trees and bushes that grew there naturally, but once inside you could climb back to the river where there was a small clearing. A place just big enough for a boy to sit, and a handy accompaniment of small rocks to toss in the river. </p>
<p>I don't know how much time I spent there, or how many times I would find myself looking for the shelter of peace and quiet, but there were enough times for me to mark it as being significant in my youth. A recent article in the opinion section of the New York Times titled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/opinion/sunday/the-quiet-ones.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;">The Quiet Ones</a> (found through a link from the excellent site <a href="http://www.enoughbook.com/the-quiet-ones-nytimes-com/">enough</a>, by Patrick Rhone) reminded me of these times, and how important it is to be able to <em>turn it all off</em>. </p>
<p>I was trying to explain to my kids last night how different the world for them is now than it was for us. We had no Internet, no cell phones, no computers. These things existed at the time, but in our small mountain town, none of the people I knew had them. If you were lucky you might have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Walkman#Cassette-based">Walkman</a>, if you were really lucky you might have a game boy, but the batteries would die, and you were left with nothing to <em>entertain</em> you. If your parents had money, they might have bought you a Nintendo, but even then we had nothing like the constant, always on, on-demand stream of entertainment and connectedness that we have today. If you wanted to talk to one of your friends, you picked up the phone attached to the wall and dialed their number on the rotary dial. Or, more likely, you just walked over to their house and knocked on the door. </p>
<p>Even the walk over to a friends house was quiet time. Time to let your imagination flow wherever it pleased. These times were important, it is in these little in-between times where we are defining ourselves. If we are constantly seeking out the feedback and approval of others, we are not giving ourselves time enough to decide who we are on our own. </p>
<p>As a parent, I want to make sure my kids have the educational and competitive edge they need to be successful when they enter the workforce. I also want to give them the things they want, just because I love them. But there are times when I worry about what the ubiquity of "free" entertainment is doing to them. We didn't have the Internet when we were kids, so we don't know what the long term effect will be fore them. Are they getting enough quiet time? Am I? It is this worry that prompts me to send them outside to play instead of watching a movie, and to restrict their Internet access, and to prompt them, again and again, to read, create or use their imagination. </p>
<p>I am not a Luddite, I'm not against technology. I make my living off of it, and I understand the internal workings of it quite well. Perhaps it is this familiarity that has begun to breed a certain type of contempt. We are lucky enough to have access to whatever we want to watch, listen to, or play, whenever we want it, but with this freedom comes the responsibility to ourselves to know when to turn it all off. </p>
<p>Turn it off, and spend some time alone, in a quiet place. </p>

<p><img src="/media/energy_saver_icon.png" /> 
My MacBook at work sits on my desk all day and all night. When I sit down to work on it, I expect it to be ready for me, and ready to ask how high when I tell it to jump. I get a bit annoyed if I come back after a few minutes or an hour and find that the Mac has gone to sleep while I've been gone. So, I spent a few minutes in the Energy Saver preference pane to configure the machine to my schedule. </p>
<p><a href="/media/general_energy_settings.png"><img src="/media/general_energy_settings_thumb.png" /></a></p>
<p>First, yes, my battery is shot. I should get that replaced, but since the Mac never leaves my desk, I don't see it as being a big deal. This is a 2007 MacBook Pro, she's got some miles on her, but she's still snappy at just about everything I want to do. I run Windows XP in VMware Fusion, and am running the latest OS X with no problems. One thing that takes a while for it to do though is wake from sleep. I can hear the CD-ROM being accessed when it wakes up, and it always takes longer than I'd like. So, when I'm working on the machine, I never let it go to sleep. However, being at least somewhat energy conscious, I want the machine to go to sleep at night when I'm not around. So, I've dragged the slider for "Computer sleep" over to 3 hrs, which gives me plenty of time for meetings and a mid-day lunch without the Mac going to sleep. </p>
<p>I let the display go to sleep after ten minutes. I find that it is rare that anything I will be reading on screen will take more than that. </p>
<p>The Schedule button in the lower right is a gem. From here I have the Mac wake up from sleep every day at 7, right as I'm sitting down to work. I also have the Mac reboot every week, midnight at Saturday. I do not necessarily believe that OS X generally needs to reboot that often, but given how much I do with mine, and the age of the system, I would rather have it reboot automatically while I'm not around than need to do it during the day when I am. </p>
<p><a href="/media/evergy_schedule.png"><img src="/media/evergy_schedule_thumb.png" /></a></p>
<p>I also have the software updates set to automatically download and install in the background. Combined with my scheduled weekly reboots, this setup should give me a clean running, up to date Mac to get things done with. </p>
<p><a href="/media/software_updates_pref.png"><img src="/media/software_updates_pref_thumb.png" /></a></p>
<p>So far, so good. I have not seen anything wrong with this setup yet.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2012-10-24-Forgotten_and_Beloved.html'>Forgotten and Beloved</a></h2>
<p>I was given a clean slate of a Mac to work with this past Monday, so I gave some thought to which apps I wanted to use. Looking back at some of my favorites that have fallen behind, I was left with a bit of nostalgia for the apps that once made the Mac experience great. It is easy to tell which developers care about keeping their application up to date, just check the top right corner and look for the full-screen opposing arrows. If they are not present, there is a good chance that the application has been abandoned. </p>
<p>Mac OS X Lion was released in July of 2011. As I write this, it is now October of 2012. If in the fifteen months that the full-screen API has been available the developer has not taken advantage of it, odds are good that they have not kept up with any of the more interesting advancements in the past year either. For the most part, the applications listed below still work well, but it is a shame that the once great have been left by the wayside.</p>
<p><img src="/media/omniweb.png" /> <em>OmniWeb</em> - <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniweb">oldest browser</a> still under development, although it may soon cede that title. OmniWeb was released in March 1995, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer">Internet Explorer</a> was released five months later in August 1995. OmniWeb's most prominent feature is visual tabs. Unlike other browsers, OmniWeb uses a drawer to show a vertical list of thumbnails of the site, making it very easy to tell which tab holds the site you are looking for. OmniWeb also has a great feature called Workspaces that saves the state of the browser, including all open windows and tabs, in groups that can be switched between. So, if you are doing a lot of research on a particular topic, and want to save where you are for later, you can save the workspace and return to it at any time. Dr. Drang recently <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/10/saving-browser-tab-sets/">wrote an applescript</a> to accomplish nearly the same thing with Safari.  OmniWeb used to be a paid application, but the OmniGroup released it for free in 2009, and it has not seen a significant upgrade since. </p>
<p><img src="/media/yojimbo.png" /> <em>Yojimbo</em> - <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/">Yojimbo</a> was released by Bare Bones Software in January 2006. I bought a copy, and upgraded to version 2 in 2009, and to version 3 in 2010. I have tried, and failed, to use Evernote and DEVONthink for the same thing I use Yojimbo for, but there is simply nothing out there that makes saving and finding data as easy and fast as Yojimbo. Over the years I got used to the Command-C, F1 keyboard sequence to copy something and throw it into the Yojimbo database. Unfortunately, when Apple made the transition from MobileMe to iCloud, the syncing feature that Yojimbo used was lost, and Bare Bones needed to do some major modification to the underlying data storage piece, modifications which are still underway. Or, so we've been told anyway, <a href="http://www.barebones.com/support/yojimbo/icloud.html">over and over again</a>. In the meantime, unless there is a major version 4 coming around the corner somewhere, Yojimbo feels like another OmniWeb; amazing at what it does, but left behind by the developer. </p>
<p><img src="/media/dl2.png" /> <em>Delicious Library</em> - I love organizing things, and <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a> was built for the obsessive compulsive in all of us. It comes with a great barcode scanner that worked before there were barcode scanners that worked. It had fun animations, it won awards, it's developers got rich or joined Apple, and then it dropped off the radar. DL3 was announced, and a request for beta testers went out, but the software has yet to be released. Delicious Library was one of the apps that I would show off to Windows users five or six years ago, and it is one of those apps that I always thought would make a natural progression to iOS and the iPad. Sadly, it seems this is not to be. </p>
<p><img src="/media/imac.png" /></p>
<p>It is understandable that each of these applications must bow to the pressure of the economy, that their developers must make decisions on what to work on based on financial benefit and health of their company. However, the loss of active development of some of the best applications available for the platform worries me. What is becoming of the developer ecosystem when the best in class is abandoned, and seven of the top twelve applications in the Mac App Store belong to Apple? The Mac has never been stronger, Apple's engineering has never been so advanced, and if there were ever a time to make your app shine, this is it.</p>

<h3>Or, Redesigning the Tablet Computer</h3>

<p><em>Evolution</em></p>
<p>Somewhere around 2000 BC, man discovered that mathematics were not exactly his strong suit. It became apparent that by using a tool external to his mind he could perform far more advanced calculations than he could in his head. Thus, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus">abacus</a> was born, the first computer.</p>
<p><a href="/media/evolution.png">Evolution of Computers</a></p>
<p>Computing technology stagnated for thousands of years before taking a giant leap forward in the 1970’s. Advances in other fields of science led to the creation of vacuum tubes and punch cards that were used in the first fully mechanical and programmable computers. The first computers were big enough to fill a large room, and had (relatively) little computing power. Over time, the computer internal components have grown smaller and smaller, to the point that now you can carry a computer with several magnitudes the computing power of the first machines in the palm of your hand.</p>
<p>While computer architecture has undergone several changes, the basic way people interface with the computer has only undergone two major transitions. The first transition was the change
from purely mechanical forms of data input like punched cards, to a digital interface via a <em>command line</em>. The command line is a simple text interface where a person types in data on a keyboard, and the computer returns information based on what the person typed. The second transition in user-computer interface was the move away from the command line to a Graphical User Interface, or GUI for short. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI">Wikipedia</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A GUI is a method of interacting with a computer through a metaphor of direct manipulation of graphical images and widgets in addition to text.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most recognizable computer GUI is the interface to Windows XP. XP uses a “desktop” and “filing cabinet” metaphor to symbolize the location of files in within the system. While this works great for simple filing systems, the amount of data needed to keep track of quickly out grows the now outdated system.</p>
<p><em>Necessity</em></p>
<p>The computer has grown smaller and larger at the same time. The physical size of computers has decreased, while the computing power and storage space has grown exponentially. Many computer users have now been using their machines for several years, and have accumulated a large amount of data in the form of documents, email, photographs, music, movies, and games. Recently, the computer industry released what they are calling the <a href="/media/umpc.png">Ultra-Mobile PC</a>, or UMPC for short. The UMPC is the culmination of the shrinking of the computer, (My how times have changed!) a full computer that you can hold in the palm of your hand. UMPCs run a full version of Windows XP Tablet PC edition, and, while functional, they suffer from the complete lack of style that often accompanies the PC marketplace. To remedy the outdated desktop, filing cabinet metaphor and create a new computing utility we need to think outside the start menu.</p>
<p>The computer operating system is the interface between the user and the computer hardware. It is the software that makes the computer cold silicone come alive and react to external stimulus. For personal computers, there are several operating systems available, but only Windows XP is widely known, mainly because of Microsoft’s 95% market share. Every PC available for purchase comes preloaded with Windows, and most users do not care to bother with another OS. While this is seemingly convenient to the user, they are being forced to learn a system that does not think like they do.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, there are several different PC operating systems. My personal favorite is the Mac OS from Apple Computer. Mac OS is based on the FreeBSD operating system, a freely available OS. Another type of freely available OS is known as Linux. Linux is “open source”, meaning that if so desired the source code is available and can be modified and redistributed by anyone. Given the “free” and “open” nature of Linux, there are literally hundreds of different “flavors” of Linux. Red Hat is one of the better known flavors, along with Suse, Slackware, and Debian. There are even flavors of Linux that are based off of other flavors. In a market dominated by a multi-billion dollar company, Linux is truly an odd bird. It is unfortunate that the two major interfaces to Linux, known as Gnome and KDE (The K Desktop Environment) both borrow heavily from Windows XP, including a start menu, nested menus, and nested folders. Linux, while free, suffers from a major drawback in being both unfamiliar to regular users (not being Windows XP), and being unintuitive to use (by trying to be Windows XP). Mac OS does a better job of presenting a more discerning interface, but also suffers from nested folders and other small interface drawbacks.</p>
<p><a href="/media/gnome.png">Gnome</a></p>
<p><a href="/media/kde.png">KDE</a></p>
<p>Using a Mac can be made much more productive by installing the free application named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezzo_(desktop_environment)">Quicksiver</a> from Blacktree. Quicksilver runs in the background and waits until the user presses a predefined key combination. Once the main Quicksilver window is available, the user types in the first few letters of what he is looking for, followed by a tab, and then the first few letters of what the user wants to do with the item selected. For example, to launch the Safari web browser, the user could type <code>S &lt;tab&gt; O &lt;enter&gt;</code> and the application would launch. Quicksilver is a major leap forward in human computer interaction, however it currently has a very steep learning curve and takes some getting used to. </p>
<p><a href="/media/quicksilver.png">Quicksilver</a></p>
<p>Another great advancement on the Mac is called Spotlight. Spotlight indexes all of the data on your computer, and all of the data about the data (or metadata) in real time. Meaning, if I have an Adobe PDF file that has something about Mezzo in it, spotlight will find it. Not only files, but emails, music, picture and most other forms of data stored on the computer. The Spotlight search functions almost instantly, building its results in real-time as you type.</p>
<p><a href="/media/spotlight.png">Searching instead of browsing with Spotlight</a></p>
<p>A creative Mac user named Jason Spisac recognized the short-comings of the current computer interface and wrote a paper now known as the “<a href="/media/symOS.pdf">Mezzo Greypaper</a>” detailing his idea of a new de- sign for a GUI named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezzo_(desktop_environment)">Mezzo</a>. In Jason’s paper, he details how major functions should be grouped in the corners of the screen, where they cannot be missed with a mouse. This idea was taken up by a group of Linux developers who are creating a new Operating System named Sym- phonyOS. The SymphonyOS is still in development, but it looks very promising. Using the ide- als and standards described in the Mezzo Greypaper they have designed a GUI with no file manager, hot corners, integrated search (via a linux application named “beagle”, not as powerful as Spotlight, but not bad either), and tight web integration.</p>
<p><a href="/media/mezzo.png">The Mezzo Interface</a></p>
<p><em>Parts is Parts</em></p>
<p>The perfect user interface would incorporate all of the components listed above; Mezzo desktop, integrated search, and a Quicksilver like manager to bring it all together. I would like to propose a new UMPC, or Tablet PC, or Navi, or whatever you would like to call it. I’ve become fond of calling it the Farmdog.</p>
<p><a href="/media/farmdog_tablet.png">The Original Farmdog Idea</a></p>
<p>Farmdog is a type of hybrid, addressing the shortcomings of the major computer systems, and designed for the user, not the computer programmer. Using a touch screen and a stylus (or tablet pen) the user can interface with the SymphonyOS using the Mezzo desktop’s hot corners to bring up different functions or access different parts of the computer. For example, moving the stylus into the lower left-hand corner of the screen would bring up a full screen menu of the installed programs. Bringing the stylus to the upper left-hand corner would give the user a menu of available documents and an integrated search box. Likewise, if something is no longer needed on the system, the user could drag the item to the lower right hand corner and be rid of it. No aiming, no hassle, no problem. Accessing quicksilver would be as easy as a tap on the screen with the stylus. Using handwriting recognition technology, the user could simply tap on the screen to bring up quicksilver, write a S, then a line to the right, then an O, followed by another tap to launch the Safari web browser. Likewise, the user could tap on the screen, write a R and a P, then tap again to open the file named “Research Paper”. All files, emails, applications, bookmarks&hellip; everything available from one simple tap of the pen.</p>
<p><em>The Art of Tech</em></p>
<p>One other technology that I would borrow from Apple’s Mac OS is called Exposé ́. Exposé is a window management system that allows the user to see all open windows as thumbnails and then choose which one is needed. The following two pictures illustrate Exposé. ́</p>
<p><a href="/media/expose.png">Exposé</a></p>
<p>Utilizing this technology on a small hand-held computer would make the headache of managing multiple application windows on a small screen a thing of the past. Even better, Exposé can be activated via a hot corner, say the upper right hand corner. So, the user has ten applications open, and needs to copy some text out of a document for inclusion in an email. Simply drag the stylus to the upper right hand corner to activate Exposé ́, select the email application, copy the text, back to the upper right hand corner, select the document, paste and your done. It may not be as fast as other methods, but it is far more natural.</p>
<p><em>Solutions</em></p>
<p>Software is only half the story. It is the ying to hardware’s yang. Farmdog’s hardware is designed to deal with the current shortcomings of computer design by using everyday technology in radically new ways.</p>
<p>Today, operating systems are distributed on a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM and loaded (copied) onto the user’s computer hard drive. This system is almost as old as computers themselves, with only the delivery method changing (floppy disks to CDs to DVDs). The problem is that during an OS upgrade, you run a very real risk of losing the data on the hard drive. And what if there is a problem with the new OS? Unless you have copied your data over to another hard drive somewhere else, there is no way to go back a revision. Farmdog is different.</p>
<p>Farmdog would have two drives. One removable flash based drive for the OS, and another standard hard drive for the user’s data. This system would have a very distinct advantage over CD-ROM based delivery methods. For one, with the entire OS on the flash drive, the user could switch between operating systems by simply shutting down the Farmdog and re- placing the flash drive. In this way, the user would not have to worry about lost or damaged data, the data would be on a completely separate drive. The hard drive would also be easily removable via a slot on the right hand side of the computer. I can imagine distributing a simple hard drive replicator to backup data even further.</p>
<p><em>Nothing New Under The Sun</em></p>
<p>I really enjoy computers. I’ve enjoyed them even more since switching to Mac. I enjoy them so much that I’ve made a career out of knowing as much as possible about how they work, and what makes them tick. Farmdog is about putting a little piece of soul back in the box, finding the ghost in the machine and setting it free. Computing without thinking, finding without doing. Farmdog wants to be your best friend.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2012-10-08-iOS_6_Headphones.html'>iOS 6 Headphones</a></h2>
<p>I have been pleasantly surprised by one small enhancement in iOS 6 that probably affected a very small number of people. I drive a 2006 Saturn Ion that has an auxiliary port in the car stereo for plugging in things like iPhones. I have about a half-hour drive to work in the mornings, and I listen to podcasts downloaded with <a href="http://vemedio.com/products/instacast">Instacast</a>. Since I want to control the audible volume with my car stereo knobs, and I want the best possible signal from my iPhone, I turn the volume up to maximum for the drive.</p>
<p>This works great, but I also have a ten to fifteen minute walk from the parking garage in Des Moines to the office where I work, so I unplug from my car and plug in Apple headphones to listen to the podcast a little more while I walk. However, I would frequently forget how the volume button works on the iPhone. When I unplugged the car stereo, iOS tells Instacast to stop playing. So, when I unplug from the car, and then turn down the volume, I'm not actually turning down the volume for Instacast, only the volume for the phone's ringer. I can't quite get my head around that, I'm not sure why we would not want one volume to rule all audio. After hitting the volume, putting in my headphones, putting them in my ear, and hitting play on Instacast again, I would get my ears nearly blown out by iOS turning the volume up to full blast again.</p>
<p>It makes sense, in a way, but it does not agree with my mental model of how I think it should work. I think that the phone should have only one volume button, for everything. So, after a few times running into this, and randomly forgetting about it for a few times, I trained myself to keep my headphones out of my ears until after I have started Instacast again and turned down the <em>real</em> volume. Until I updated to iOS 6, and I noticed something a little different. </p>
<p>It took a few times to notice the change, and when I did notice it I watched it to make sure it was doing what I thought it was doing. I would unplug from the car, and plug in my headphones, start Instacast, and hit the volume, I would not be able to hear anything, the volume was already down at around half. Then I noticed that when I got back to my car and swapped the other way, I did not have to turn the volume back up again. iOS 6 remembers the volume setting for different headphones. </p>
<p>It may only remember the setting between Apple iPhone headphones with the microphone and control on the right ear bud wire and a regular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS_connector">3.5mm TSR to TSR plug</a>, but it is still such a nice addition. Once I realized the change, it made me smile. Apple has removed one small point of friction from iOS, and it is the kind of change that shows their focus on everyday use, and not just technical excellence.</p>

<p>Part of a Farmdog project I'm working on needs nice syntax highlighting for markdown. After searching around for a bit I found Ali Rantakari's <a href="http://hasseg.org/peg-markdown-highlight/">PEG Markdown Highlight</a> project, and knew that it would be a perfect fit. Unfortunately, the code was not written for <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html">ARC</a>, or Automatic Reference Counting, and my project was. Rantakari's code worked fantastic outside of ARC, but inside it needed a few days worth of love and attention. </p>
<p>I tried to dig through and fix the errors in my project, but after a while it seemed like a better idea to rip it out, start a blank Xcode project and do all of the fixing there. Thus, <a href="https://github.com/jbuys/ArcDown">ArcDown</a> was born. </p>
<p>ArcDown is a reference project, intended to be an example of how to use the PEG Markdown Highlight in your project. It's far from perfect, not even close to finished, and is not going to replace MacVim for me any time soon, but it is a fun project to work on at night. If you are interested, ArcDown is released under the MIT license, so, fork away.</p>

<p>Learning about computers can be a dangerous thing. Breaking though the veneer of graphical interfaces reveals inefficiencies and inaccurate metaphors. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a> copies files faster and uses fewer resources than the Finder. Copying lots of files is what rsync does best, but being a command line power tool there are a few subtleties with using it that are not readily apparent. As your skill grows, so to does the tendency to eschew modern tools in favor of "power tools". You begin to see the inefficiencies of graphical tools as problems, problems that you need to fix. I've been down that road. </p>
<p>Power tools are impressive, but they also lend themselves to <em>fiddling</em>, spending more time configuring the tool than actually using it to get work done. Or worse, you need to stop tracking on what you are doing at the time to think about <em>how</em> to accomplish the next task. I was reminded of this as I was writing the first two New Mac Essentials posts, and realized that I needed to reread my own <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/04-03-2011/Principle_of_Least_Software.html">Principle of Least Software</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use only the software that you <em>need</em>. No more, no less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was recently in Chicago attending training for Hadoop. I used DEVONthink to take notes and sync them over to my phone. I also used it to collect PDFs and web archives of documentation. It worked fairly well, but after thinking the experience thorough I found very little that I did with DEVONthink that I could not do with TextEdit and the Finder. I've obsessed over the ability to sync data to my phone, but the truth is that there have been very few times that I actually used that data. </p>
<p>DEVONthink was on my list of Mac Essentials, but I'm removing it. I have spent far too long thinking about how files are stored and the most efficient way to get to them. I’ve spent too long thinking about how to “manage a project”, instead of moving on to the next task in the project. When I consider my own tendency to overcomplicate my computer use, I realize that being the fiddly geek who spends his time tweaking his .muttrc file is not the guy I want to be. I believe in learning your tools, and learning them well, but I also believe in using as little software as possible. Most of all, I believe in using your computer as the tool it was intended to be. A bicycle for the mind. </p>

<p>When I bring my computer to life in the morning I want as little friction as possible between me and the tasks I need to accomplish. I can’t afford to think about the most efficient way to store a task, or file a PDF, or title an email. I simply need to <em>do</em> the task, read the document, and write the email. So, I’ve spent a good portion of today reorganizing my files, removing unnecessary applications, and streamlining my process. Time spent sharpening the saw is time well invested. </p>
<p>The kind of computer user I want to be is the kind who uses the simplest tool available, and does so with speed, accuracy, and <em>finesse</em>. </p>

<p><em>Configuration</em></p>
<p>My configuration is kept in Dropbox in a folder named Vim. I create three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link">symlinks</a> in my home directory.</p>
<pre><code>ln -s ~/Dropbox/Vim ~/.vim
ln -s ~/Dropbox/Vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
ln -s ~/Dropbox/Vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
</code></pre>
<p>MacVim is customized through plugins. The history and legacy code behind the plugins make them unwieldy to maintain, so the first plugin I install is one to manage other plugins. <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332">Pathogen</a> by Tim Pope allows you to use Git to install other plugins, and keep them nicely organized in <code>~/.vim/bundle</code>. The GitHub page for Pathogen includes simple installation instructions. From here, to install other plugins, clone that plugin's Git repository into the <code>bundle</code> directory.  </p>
<p>I have found that the list of plugins I use changes every so often according to what language I'm working in or what task I'm working on. Vim is much like Linux… infinitely tweakable, and, if you are not careful, it can turn into a vast time sink. However, if you can curb your nerd impulse to optimize endlessly, and find a configuration that works for you, Vim will be your constant companion, always there for you when needed. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2011/i-hate-computers-but-i-love-what-you-can-do-with-them/">Bruce Lawson</a> has a few interesting things to say about computers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may think it a badge of honour that you can do “sudo dpkg -i –force-all cupswrapperHL2270DW-2.0.4-2a.i386.deb” from memory. I think you’re burying your turds with a trowel in a thunderstorm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a good article, well worth a read. I'm a systems administrator with a degree in Human Computer Interaction, so what Bruce has to say about command line and graphical applications is right up my alley. The field of systems administration has not changed much in the past thirty years since the release of Unix upon the world. While I have not been using a computer for that long, thanks to the Navy I have seen the advancement of technology first hand from vacuum tubes and punched paper tape to the MacBook Air I'm typing this on. I still need to open a terminal emulator and type arcane spells in strange fonts, whispering curses against whoever decided to design the config file <em>that</em> way. </p>
<p>Spending time in the terminal over several years gives me a feeling of familiarity with the environment. I know my spells well, and can generally accomplish what I'm setting out to do with little hassle. However, simply because I am familiar with a setup does not mean that it is the best, just the one I know how to use. I have railed against GUIs as a sysadmin, and with good cause. Most GUI's designed for the back end systems are horrible. Configuring a switch through a gigantic Java application that, one, uses no native controls, and two, is slow, and three, is unstable and may crash is a terrible way to work. Little to no thought is put into usability of these systems, so of course I would rather use a command line. Building a well designed application is <em>hard</em>. </p>
<p>I've been reading the Steve Jobs biography, and what struck me in the first portion of the book was how hard the original Macintosh team worked to make a computer easy to use. Jobs was famously demanding to work for, and would become furious when complexity was exposed to the person using the computer. The sysadmin field needs a Steve Jobs and an Apple, because currently the best we can come up with is increasingly complicated scripts to automate the tasks we need to do on the servers. If a task can be scripted, it can also be designed, animated, and brought to life in the modern age of computing. </p>
<p>The command line fetish does not end in the data center though. <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/07/24/the-sparrow-problem">Sparrow</a> was recently the subject of a kerfuffle, and the state of desktop email clients was discussed on <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/87">Build &amp; Analyze</a>.

<p>Seth is a scientist, and no slouch when it comes to thinking through computer interaction. I value his opinion, so so it will be interesting to see what he comes up with. I too have used Mutt as my email client in the past, and became frustrated with basic things like dealing with attachments. My frustrations are not unique, and the reason graphical clients like Apple's Mail exist; to make the task of reading and sending email easier. </p>
<p>Mutt is powerful, and when properly configured can ease the burden of dealing with large amounts of email, but at a cost. To me, using Mutt always felt like I was tossing out twenty years of HCI research and design. Unlike data center applications, consumer facing applications have advanced greatly in usability. </p>
<p>Being a "power user" does not mean you need to disregard graphical applications. It means you learn whatever application you decide on inside and out. </p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2012-07-22-Should_All_Software_Be_Free?.html'>Should All Software Be Free</a></h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We live in the information age. Digital devices and Internet connected, hand held computers are the prevalent way we communicate. The price for computers and for access to the Internet has dropped, and availability of publicly accessible Internet connected computers has risen. Schools across the country are providing computers to their students, some as early as sixth grade, and public libraries have been equipped with computers and, in some cases, free wireless Internet access. With the prevalence of computers of all shapes and sizes across nearly all parts of our society, questions about their ethical use and the purpose and place of computers in our lives have risen. One such question that has been debated since the early 1980s is “Should all software be free?”</p>
<p>“Free” in the English language is a fairly relative term. The New Oxford American Dictionary contains eight definitions of the word “free”, as well as an additional two adverb uses of the word. In the context of the question above, “Should all software be free”, the obvious meaning of the word is the fifth definition, which reads “given or available without charge”. However, the more academically interesting, accurate, and perhaps even subversive meaning of the word free is the first definition, which reads “not under the control or in the power of another; able to act or be done as one wishes”. Most computers shipped today come pre-installed with software that does not fall under either of these definitions of free, but should they? From a purely ethical context, should the user of software be able to copy, modify, and redistribute software as he sees fit? What are the social implications of an enmasse migration to free software?</p>
<p>There are many answers to this question, depending on who you ask. On one end of the spectrum are large proprietary software companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Apple. These companies view software the same as they would a physical product, like a toaster. They design, engineer, and test the software, then package it and sell it to consumers to run on their computers.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum is the Free Software Foundation, founded by Richard Stallman, who evangelizes the philosophy that all software, independent of the original author, should be free of restrictions.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1983 Richard Stallman was working as a programmer in the artificial intelligence lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). By this time in his career, he had already garnered a certain amount of recognition in the small but burgeoning hacker community as a talented developer, largely due to his creation of the EMACS text editor, and his academic papers on artificial intelligence. Stallman embraced the openness and sharing of the hacker community, and found an ethos that would shape his career in the years to come. Towards the end of his work at MIT, Stallman found an increasing amount of proprietary software in use where he worked. One example in particular was a new printer that was installed on the network, which he was unable to gain access to the source code to. In a previous printer, he was able to expand the functionality of it to send messages when a printing job completed. Stallman’s inability to enhance the functionality of the printer based on the companies unwillingness to share source code with him was instrumental in convincing Stallman that proprietary software was ethically wrong. Stallman recalled the beginnings of the GNU project at a talk he gave at Google:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So I found myself in a situation where the only way you could get a modern computer and start to use it was to sign a non-disclosure agreement for some proprietary operating system. Because all the operating systems for modern computers in 1983 were proprietary, and there was no lawful way to get a copy of those operating systems without signing a non-disclosure agreement, which was unethical.” (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/google-engineering-talk.html">Stallman, 2004</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shortly thereafter, he started the GNU project.</p>
<p>GNU is a recursive acronym for “GNUs Not Unix” , a play on words to indicate the purpose of the project, to create a Unix-like operating system that is freely available to anyone. The project was announced in late 1983, and officially started in early 1984. Stallman created a debugger (gdb), and a C compiler (gcc), and ported his popular text editor EMACS to the project as GNU EMACS. Launching the GNU project officially started the Free Software Movement, and Richard Stallman created a non-profit corporation named the Free Software Foundation to support the objectives of the new movement. (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">Stallman, 2010</a>)</p>
<p>The GNU project worked for the next several years to develop the operating system, but were unable to successfully develop a reliable kernel, the core of the system. In 1991, an unexpected answer to this problem came in the form of a Finnish college student named Linus Torvalds who developed a clone of an educational version of the Unix kernel and named it Linux. Linus licensed his new kernel under the GNU GPL, and combined his new kernel with the GNU userland tools to create a fully functional operating system, properly named GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>The Free Software Foundation defines four essential “freedoms” that all people using software should have the right to enjoy. Using a hacker mentality, the freedoms are numbered starting at zero, a common programming practice. The four software freedoms are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program, for any purpose</li>
<li>Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
<li>Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor</li>
<li>Freedom 3: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to meet the Free Software Foundation’s definition of free software, an application’s licensing must meet all of these requirements. The FSF maintains a list of licenses that they find meet the definition of free software on their web site. The four freedoms are devised to give the user of the software complete control over their computing environment. For example, in an office environment where there are several computers, free software would enable the users to modify the application to suit their needs, and install the application on as many computers as they wished, without having to worry about additional software licensing or the possibility of breaking a contract with the developers of the software.</p>
<p>While the GNU project was founded to recreate a Unix-like operating system from scratch, another project was created that derived it’s source code from the original Bell Labs Unix directly.
During the late 1970’s the University of California, Berkeley worked closely with Bell Labs developing the Unix operating system, sharing source code and fixes between the two. Berkley’s version of Unix became known as the Berkeley Systems Distribution, or BSD, and was distributed to colleges along with a license. When Bell Labs was bought out by AT&amp;T, the focus of Unix development shifted to a stable, proprietary model for marketing to clients. AT&amp;T changed the terms of the source code license to charge a substantial fee for universities to gain access to the source code. Around this same time, Berkeley independently developed a networking stack for the TCP/IP protocol for Unix, combined it with their BSD version, and made the source code available for a substantially lower fee. Encouraged by other universities and people interested in BSD, Berkeley continued working on rewriting utilities developed by AT&amp;T for inclusion in BSD.</p>
<p>Through several iterations, splits, and rewriting of source code utilities and kernel files, there eventually appeared three versions of BSD: NetBSD, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD. There was also a fourth version, BSDi which was a commercial venture based off of the earlier works of Berkeley and their own rewritten kernel. (Bretthauer, 2002) Although BSD can clearly trace the ancestry of its code back to the original Unix of Bell Labs, due to a legal complication, no version of BSD can officially be called “Unix”. The Unix name is a trademark owned by Novell, who was recently purchased by Attachmate.</p>
<p>The commercial version of Unix was adopted by several vendors, and is now actively being sold and supported by IBM as AIX, HP as HP-UX, and Oracle as Solaris. Before being acquired by Oracle, Sun Microsystems released the source code of Solaris as OpenSolaris. Since the acquisition, the OpenSolaris project has been rumored to be disbanded in the near future. In response to the rumors, OpenSolaris has spawned the Illumos project to continue development of the released code.</p>
<p>BSD, along with the Mach kernel, also provides the core of both Apple’s Mac OS X and iOS operating systems. 4.4BSD was incorporated into NEXTSTEP, which was developed by NeXT corporation. Apple acquired NeXT in 1996, and began work incorporating NEXTSTEP into the Mac OS. Mac OS X Developer Preview 1, based on NEXTSTEP, which was based on BSD, was released in May 1999. (Singh, 2003) In 2007, Apple released the iPhone, running a stripped down, minimalistic version of OS X which was later renamed iOS. iOS and Mac OS X share a common ancestry that maps back to BSD, and from there back to Bell Labs and the original Unix.</p>
<h2>Software Licenses</h2>
<p>Although Mac OS X shares it’s history with the BSD variants, only a limited subset of its source code is available outside of Apple. Apple has made significant changes to the core source files of BSD, and released their version of BSD in a limited fashion as Darwin. Apple released a downloadable installer for Darwin as an image file (ISO) that could be burned to a CD-R, up until 2007, which corresponded with the release of Mac OS 10.5, Leopard. After this point, Apple released only the source code required by the license for open source tools included in Mac OS X or iOS. Apple utilized the BSD operating system, wrote their own tools and layers on top of it, repackage it, and sell the new operating system as their own. They were able to do this because of the liberal BSD license, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:
* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.
* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution. ("Open source initiative," )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The BSD license does not place restrictions on how the source code or binary programs are used or distributed, allowing that the redistributed application attribute BSD. This license reflects the academic roots and philosophy of the developers of BSD, who wished to make the system as open as possible to contribution. This style of license is very different from the license adopted by the GNU project, who developed the license based not only on their own philosophy that software should be free of restrictions, but also their own moral code.</p>
<p>To enforce the four essential freedoms, the GNU project created the GNU General Public License, or GPL for short. The GPL is a copyright license, legally enforceable, that protects the rights of users to create, modify, and distribute free software. The GPL also restricts what developers can do with code that they use that is already covered under the GPL. The GPL explicitly prevents developers from adding to, or deriving from, GPL code to create a new product, without also covering that code under the GPL. This restriction gives the GPL a viral aspect, as it can be seen to infect all other code it touches. If Apple had based Mac OS X on a core of GNU/Linux instead of BSD, it is very likely that Apple could have become entangled in a costly legal battle over he right to distribute their code in binary form.</p>
<p>For applications to comply with Freedom 0 as defined by the Free Software Foundation, the applications must allow no possibility to restrict the application from running. (Stallman, 2004)
This means that any type of license key enforcement or digital rights management software would be prohibited. In contrast, the iPhone contains software which can only be used for one purpose, as stated by the <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/iphone/us/terms/sla.html">iPhone Software License Agreement</a>, section 2a, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you are granted a limited non- exclusive license to use the iPhone Software on a single Apple-branded iPhone. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The definitions of freedom offered by the Free Software Foundation act on the assumption that computers are central to a persons well being, and that there should be a natural right possessed by the user of any computer to have full and complete access to the computer based on that natural right to well being. However, it is my position that computers, or any other form of technology, only serve to increase personal freedom of the user in proportion to the increase in overall quality of life of the user of the technology. If the user possesses no knowledge of programming languages, than access to the source code does him little good. However, the user can hire a programmer to modify the source code for him, or group together with other users to raise a larger amount of money for the programmer, depending on the difficulty of the change requested.</p>
<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>In chapter four, section 2, of the textbook Ethics for the Information Age, intellectual property is defined as “any unique product of the human intellect that has commercial value”. </p>
<p>This concept of property is derived from John Locke’s writing The Second Treatise of Government, where Locke states that people have a right to their own labor, and a right to things that they have removed from nature through their own labor. The text then brings up an example of how this right can be misconstrued with the concept of intellectual property using William Shakespeare writing Hamlet. If Shakespeare writes Hamlet in a pub one night after listening to the rumors of royal intrigue, than it is agreed that the play is the result of his labor, and therefor he should have the right of ownership to it. However, if Ben Jonson listens to the same rumors in a separate pub across town, and then simultaneously with, but independent of, Shakespeare, writes Hamlet, then the text claims that ownership of the intellectual work is in question. There were two authors, but only one work, which creates a paradox when viewed in light of Locke’s reasoning.</p>
<p>The text is using flawed reasoning in this example. According to the text, “even though Jonson and Shakespeare worked independently, there is only one Hamlet”, but that two creative people could work independently to create the exact same work is impossible. The actual outcome of the Shakespeare example would be that there were two plays, Hamlet, and a very similar, but different, play written by Jonson. The text appears to be begging the question, since it assumes that the possibility of identical creative works is realistic.</p>
<p>If we assume that software is a creative work, similar to writing, art, or music, than it is logically assumed that the original author of the software is entitled to some form of ownership. </p>
<p>Copyright law dates back to the original printing press and the first ability to create copies of creative works quickly and efficiently. The first copyright law was passed in 1735 by the English Parliament as the First English Copyright Act, recognizing an original authors right to his creative work. (<a href="http://cnx.org/content/m13912/1.2/#footnote1">Ballon, &amp; Westermann, 2006</a>)</p>
<p>The GNU project takes a contrary stand on the subject of ownership of software. Richard Stallman, in his essay entitled “Why Software Should Not Have Owners” claims that authors of software can claim no natural right to their work, citing the difference between physical products and software, and rejecting the concept of a tradition of copyright. Stallman uses an example of cooking a plate of spaghetti to explain the difference between software and physical products:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When I cook spaghetti, I do object if someone else eats it, because then I cannot eat it. His action hurts me exactly as much as it benefits him; only one of us can eat the spaghetti, so the question is, which one? The smallest distinction between us is enough to tip the ethical balance.
But whether you run or change a program I wrote affects you directly and me only indirectly. Whether you give a copy to your friend affects you and your friend much more than it affects me. I shouldn't have the power to tell you not to do these things. No one should.” (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-free.html">Stallman, 2010</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Stallman does not address what gives the second person who receives the software the right to benefit from the authors work without giving something in return.</p>
<h2>Ethical Frameworks</h2>
<p>Before the industrial revolution, most people learned a skill and worked for themselves in small communities. A single village would have all of the skill sets necessary to sustain itself, and each member of the community would apprentice into a particular skill set to contribute and earn a living. The industrial revolution pushed skilled workers into factories and assembly lines, work that was both distasteful and disdainful to an artisan in the craft. However, corporations were able to reduce cost and increase profits, and the platform has persisted into current work environments. </p>
<p>In the information age, the assembly line mindset has created oceans of cubicles filled with programmers who use their skills in small parts of large software projects, sometimes to great success, but far too often to failure. The Internet and popularity of lower priced computers has created a market for high quality third party software, the kind that is created by someone with a passion for what they are doing. This passion comes from learning a craft, and using that skill to earn a living, just like the workers from before the industrial revolution. Instead of living physically in small villages, these new age artisans live online and create communities built around social networking. (<a href="http://indie-research.blogspot.com/">van Meeteren, 2008</a>) </p>
<p>In many ways, this is a return to a more natural way of life, and a simple form of commerce. One person can create an application and sell it, and another person can buy it from him. The person selling the software benefits from being able to purchase shelter, food, and clothing for his family, and the person who buys the software benefits from the use of the software. It is a very simple transaction, and a model that is not adequately explained in the GNU essays. If all proprietary software is wrong, then an independent developer who sells software as his only job is also wrong.</p>
<p>GNU supporters could argue that there is nothing stopping the programmer from selling his software, but he should give away the source code under a license that permits redistribution along with the software once it is sold. At this point, selling the original program no longer becomes a viable business model. A programmer can not continue to sell his software when the user can, and is encouraged to, download his software from somewhere else for free.</p>
<p>While it may be the ethically right thing to do to purchase the software if you intend to use it, ethics alone are often insignificant motivation to encourage people to spend their money. If the choice of supporting the development of the software or not is entirely up to the user of the software, then purchasing the software becomes a choice that the user can make on a whim, with no real implications on the conscience of the user with either decision. GNU and the GPL place this decision squarely on the user, and encourage the users to not feel in any way obligated to pay.</p>
<p>The ethics of open source come into question when the requirement of adhering to the free software philosophies result in an independent developer not being able to support a moderate, middle-class lifestyle by developing a relatively popular application. Kant’s first formulation asks what would happen if all developers gave away the source of their code for free. The developer being the agent, his maxim would be giving away the source code of the application he developed to earn money. In this imaginary world where all developers did this, the quality of software would go down to the lowest common denominator of acceptability. Each developers motivation would be to develop for himself, and since he would need to find a source of income elsewhere, only in the free time allotted to him. This would result in a wide variety of software availability, with very little integration, testing, or source control, mirroring the current state of GNU/Linux based desktop operating systems.</p>
<p>Current software companies would move to a business model arranged around providing support to customers of their software. Competition, and therefore innovation, based on pure software features would decrease, since the source code of any feature another group could develop would be easily copied and integrated into competitors products.</p>
<p>From a utilitarian point of view, the outcome of proprietary software has clearly been to produce more pleasure for more people than open source has up to this point. Open source software is often more complicated, difficult to learn and maintain, and harder for the average computer user to use. Apple produces proprietary software and hardware, and states their mission to “make the best stuff”. Using their position as a leading software company, and leveraging their control over their computing environment, including iPads, iPods, iPhones, and Mac computers, Apple has been able to successfully negotiate deals with entertainment companies. The deals Apple has made allow the consumer to download music, television shows, and movies off of the Internet and watch them on any Apple branded device, and output the media to their televisions or home stereo systems. Because of the limits of Digital Rights Management, open source or free systems have not been able to provide this level of entertainment.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To answer the question of whether all software should be free, this article has examined a brief history of open source software, the concept of intellectual property, and finally an ethical analysis of the concepts of open source. I have found that there is a strong connection between an original author and their work, but have found no evidence or compelling argument that all software, or all forms of any genre of creative work, should be free of restrictions. I have found that there is a benefit of open source and free software to the public, cited numerous times in the essays of Richard Stallman and the GNU project. Free software enables the user to learn the intricacies of how the software works, and modify the software to suit his needs. Free software also provides a legal and ethical alternative to expensive proprietary software in developing nations or areas where the cost of obtaining a license for legal use of the software is prohibitive. Public institutions, like schools and government offices, where the focus of the organization is the public good, have the option to use software that is in the public domain and is not controlled by any one company. Free software also gives the user the option to “help their friend” by giving them a copy of the software, without having to worry about payment or licensing restrictions.</p>
<p>I have also found compelling evidence that proprietary software is beneficial to the public, as well as respectful of the original authors rights regarding their creative work. Software is the result of a person’s labor; it does not matter how easy it is to copy that work, the author still retains a natural right of ownership, according to John Locke’s The Second Treatise of Government.
Proprietary software enables products like the iPad, which is being used to enable elderly people, nearly blind with cataracts, to create creative works of their own. (<a href="http://www.portlandtribune.com/features/story.php?story_id=128882605915653000">Newell, 2010</a>) The iPad is also being used by caretakers of severely disabled children to enable them to communicate and express themselves. (<a href="http://www .nytimes.com/2010/10/31/nyregion/31owen.html">Hager, 2010</a>) It is possible that the iPad would have been created if the software used to power it had been free, but that is unknown. What is known is that the net result of the device is to better peoples lives, which is the true purpose of technology. Any technology is merely an enabler to get more satisfaction and enjoyment out of life.</p>
<p>The free software movement exaggerates the importance of a specific type of freedom, without addressing the proper place of technology in our lives.</p>
<p>The existence of free and open source software alongside proprietary software creates a mutually beneficial loop, wherein consumers and developers are able to reap the rewards of constant innovation and competition. I have found that there is a place for both proprietary and free software, and that the authors natural right to their creative work gives them the freedom to choose how and why their software will be distributed.</p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2012-07-19-New_Mac_Essentials.html'>New Mac Essentials - Quicksilver</a></h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Setting up a new Mac can be fun, but time consuming too. As I scan the icons in my dock, I see several that will not be there when I upgrade to Mountain Lion. As well compartmentalized as OS X is, and as well as it handles applications, I still like to keep things as clean as possible. </p>
<p>Part of keeping things clean is using the applications that ship with OS X. I use Safari for my browser, with my own <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/01-27-2011/Keyboard_Driven_Safari.html">setup</a>, Mail for Email, iChat for instant messaging, and iCal for my calendar. All of my music is in iTunes, including my Grateful Dead collection. If Apple shipped a decent Twitter client and RSS feed reader, I'd use those too, but since they don't, this is where my short list of third party applications starts.</p>
<p>For Twitter, I like using <a href="http://hibariapp.com/">Hibari</a>. It is a very simple and clean application, and I love the <a href="http://violasong.com/2012/01/hibari-design-philosophy">design philosophy</a> behind it. I do wish it had a few extra features, like viewing someone's profile in the app, or showing photographs similarly to the way the Twitter desktop app does it, but other than that I really like it. </p>
<p>My RSS feeds are all in <a href="http://netnewswireapp.com/">NetNewsWire</a>, synced to Google Reader. Checking my list I see that I'm subscribed to 26 carefully selected sites. This list is continually revised, and if I find one that is not holding my interest as well as I'd like, it gets dropped from the list. </p>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html">DEVONthink</a> as my <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2009/09/yojimbo-and-anything-buckets/">anything bucket</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-10/st_thompson/">outboard brain</a>. I've gone back and forth between DEVONthink, Evernote, and Yojimbo, but find DEVONthink gives me the features that I want, without reliance on some amorphous cloud.  </p>
<p>This is where things start to get a little geeky. I initially intended for this to be a single post, but as I write, it seems like it would be better to break it down into a series of smaller posts, each dedicated to a single app. Below is the list of apps that I use on a daily basis, and each has a story. </p>

<h2>Quicksilver</h2>
<p>Quicksilver is the king of productivity hacks for the Mac. Few applications can claim to have the impact on how a person uses their computer more than Quicksilver. At it's most base form, Quicksilver is an application launcher, but it is also so much more than that. Setup however, takes a bit of work. </p>
<p>First, grab some plugins from Quicksilver's preferences panel. The important ones, to me, are <em>"User Interface Plugin"</em>, <em>"Clipboard Plugin"</em>, <em>"1Password Plugin</em>", and <em>"Web Search Module</em>". You can see the full list that I currently use in the screenshot below.</p>
<p><a href="/media/qsprefs.png"><img src="/media/qsprefs_thumb.png" /></a></p>
<p>Next, select the "Catalog" tab, then the "Quicksilver" item from the left view, and enable <em>"Internal Commands"</em>, <em>"Internal Objects"</em>, and <em>"Proxy Objects"</em>. These sources give Quicksilver some very interesting abilities. Click on the "Custom" item from the left view, and click the plus icon on the bottom and select "Web Search List". In the drawer that opens on the right, click the plus icon and edit the "Name" field to be <em>"ddg"</em>, and the URL field to be: </p>
<pre><code>https://duckduckgo.com/?q=***
</code></pre>
<p>Now select the "Triggers" section of the preference pane, and click the plus icon on the bottom, then select "HotKey", and in the field marked "Select an item" type <em>"ddg"</em>, and then tab to the next field and type <em>"Search For"</em>. Next, tab to the "Target" field, which will automatically be populated with text. We do not want this text in our trigger, so we will right click on this field and select "Remove". Now click "Save". </p>
<p><a href="/media/ddg_setup.png"><img src="/media/ddg_setup_thumb.png" /></a></p>
<p>Double-click on the "HotKey" field to open up a drawer on the right hand side of the preferences window and assign your preferred hot key. I prefer Option-Space. Now, whenever I type my hotkey, Quicksilver opens with the third text panel open ready for me to type my DuckDuckGo search for whatever I'm looking for. When I hit return, Quicksilver opens Safari with my search results, and since I use DuckDuckGo, I use the vi keyboard commands to navigate the results, and Command-Return to open the selected results in a background tab. </p>
<p>Click the plus button at the bottom of the Triggers panel to create a new custom trigger. Type <em>"Current Application"</em>, then tab to the next panel and type <em>"Show Menu Items"</em> and click "Save". Double-click the "HotKey" field again, and assign a new key combo to this trigger. I prefer Control-Space. This trigger gives us quick access to the menu items of whatever application has focus at the time. For example, I use it quite a bit in <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a> to group items. Any application that makes heavy use of menu items (like Photoshop) is a great fit for this trigger. </p>
<p><a href="/media/current_app.png"><img src="/media/current_app_thumb.png" /></a></p>
<p>Create another custom trigger, but this time type <em>"Show Clipboard"</em>. The default action should be <em>"Run"</em>, so save this command and assign it a key combo. I use Shift-Command-V. Make sure you are capturing your clipboard history in the Preferences tab. </p>
<p><a href="/media/show_clipboard.png"><img src="/media/show_clipboard_thumb.png" /></a></p>
<p>It is worth spending some time in the preferences, actions, and triggers portions of Quicksilver's configuration. There be gold in dem hills. I've covered what portions of Quicksilver I use, but it can do much, much more. Now that it is under rapid development again, I look forward to many more years of use. </p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2012-06-14-The_Winchester_Imperative.html'>The Winchester Imperative</a></h2>
<p>Major Charles Emerson Winchester III was a fictional character on one of my all time favorite shows, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Emerson_Winchester_III#Charles_Winchester">M*A*S*H</a>. While he had many memorable scenes, the one that I remember best is the first episode he is introduced. Winchester was sent to the 4077th to assist while they were short handed, and he was not used to the incredibly hectic pace that the doctors needed to work at to save the lives of the wounded. The doctors tried to prod Winchester to move faster, but he responded with a line that's been echoing in my mind lately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do one thing at a time, I do it <em>very</em> well, and then I move on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You really don't know how your workflow will stand up until you have more to do than you can handle. Since joining T8, I've felt a little like Winchester, but instead of keeping his resolve, I've felt my workflow crumble as I move into <em>reactive</em> mode. Instead of planning my work, and addressing one task at a time, doing it very well, and moving on, I've been responding to an increasingly complex influx of information.  This does not put me in a position to do my best work. </p>
<p>Of course, this is no ones fault by my own, and a problem I intend to address immediately. A cursory glance at my work situation would  indicate that I'm a perfect candidate for Getting Things Done. I've read the book, and I have a system which centers around <a href="http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist">The Hit List</a>, but the system only works if you put everything in it. For example, I have tasks which require my attention that are entered into the shared task management/bug tracker system, and tasks assigned from the customer-facing ticketing system, and email, and phone calls, and face to face talks. My system started to break down as soon as I had more than one place to check for tasks. If I'm checking email, as well as the ticketing systems, as well as The Hit List, than requests for my time are not being appropriately prioritized. But, as they say, recognizing the problem is half the battle. </p>
<p>So, here is my plan of attack for the next week or so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check email at 7, 10, 1, and 4. If something is urgent and needs my attention immediately, it would come over my phone. </li>
<li>Check the ticketing systems immediately after email, pull anything needing my attention into The Hit List.</li>
<li>Prioritize, then break projects into their own lists </li>
<li>Assign a due date to each task.</li>
<li>Go to the top of the "Due Today" list, and get it done.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step three above is easy to overlook, but is vitally important. I'm purposefully scheduling time to think. Thinking critically about my work is necessary. I not only need to prioritize each thought that appears in my inbox, I need to be able to discern what it is that each task is actually asking of me. I need this information before I can get to step five, which I call the "Winchester Imperative": do one task at a time, do it very well, and then move on.</p>
<p>I will be using this new schedule starting tomorrow. If it works well, I should have more time, and more cognitive resources available, to post an update to how it is going. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2012-05-18-A_New_World.html'>A New World</a></h2>
<p>CocoaHeads changed my life. This afternoon I am killing time in a coffee shop, about to head to work for an appointment with HR. When I get there, I'll turn in my badge, they will wish me luck, and I'll walk out the door. Monday, I start a new chapter in my life with <a href="http://www.t8webware.com/">T8 Webware</a>. To say that I'm a little nervous about this change would be an understatement. I've spent time with these guys, they are smart, ambitious, and I believe in what they are doing. I'm going to be part of building something awesome, and I'm extremely excited.</p>
<p>I met the guys from T8 at CocoaHeads months ago. We got to talking, and found that we had mutual interests. We met for lunch, I visited their main office (which is beautiful, by the way), we had lunch again, we talked and talked, and they made me an offer. My life is changing because I took the time to learn something new, and to reach out to others who shared the my interests. <a href="http://farmdogapps.com">Go2</a> will never make me independently wealthy, but it did open up new doors and bring me to meet people and have experiences I would have missed out on otherwise.  </p>
<p>I haven't been to a CocoaHeads meeting lately. Between raising my family and finishing my masters degree, I haven't had the time. Now that things are falling back into place, I think I owe them a visit. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2011-10-14-Recovering_Data_From_Filevault_Encrypted_Drive.html'>Recovering Data From FileVault Full Disk Encryption</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: If you do not have your recovery key, or if you have lost your passphrase, this post will not help you. Sorry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, just for kicks, say you did not backup your Mac for a couple of weeks. Further, let's say that, being shrewd about security, you turned on full disk encryption on your Mac. This was me, Wednesday, deciding to upgrade to OS X 10.7.2, knowing full well that I had skipped the last weekends scheduled <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> backup. Foolish and foolhearty, I know. I found out exactly how foolish it was when my precious MacBook Pro began to exhibit progressively stranger behavior as the day went on. Thursday morning, it would not boot at all, and would power off after unlocking the FileVault encrypted drive.  </p>
<p>So, no problem, I have a clone, which, true, is a couple weeks old, but I thought I could just boot off of that and copy the newer data off my failed OS X install. A plan which would have worked perfectly if I had not encrypted the drive. I could see my internal disk when booted off the clone drive, but I could find no way to unlock the disk to get to the data. Disk Utility showed the internal drive as being present and fine, but the one partition on it was marked as "unknown", since it was not unlocked at boot time. </p>
<p>Luckily, Disk Utility has a command line version called <em>diskutil</em>, with more options and fine grained control. However, the command that I needed called for knowing the <em>UUID</em> of the disk, which I did not have. The command <code>diskutil ca list</code> will show you the UUID, sometimes, but I could not see the UUID of the logical volume of the disk I needed, I could only see the UUID of the physical volume (Incidentally, for more information on the new volume manager, check out the Ars Technica Lion review covering Core Storage <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars/13">here</a>.) I'm not sure what the rules are governing how and why diskutil will show the UUID, but I could not see the internal drive's UUID when booted from the clone. Without the UUID, I could not get to my data. </p>
<p>So, I booted off the Lion recovery partition by holding down <em>⌘ R</em> after pressing the power button. After booting up, I opened the Terminal and typed <code>diskutil cs list</code>. Now we were getting somewhere. </p>
<pre><code>Logical Volume B15D4021-F519-4F7B-9B78-D4001361BA32 B15D4021-F519-4F7B-9B44444001361BA32
</code></pre>
<p>The recovery partition <em>was</em> able to see the logical volume, but it was locked. To unlock the volume, I entered this command:</p>
<pre><code>diskutil cs unlockVolume B15D4021-F519-4F7B-9B78-D4001361BA32 -stdinpassphrase
</code></pre>
<p>The diskutil command prompted me for my passphrase, unlocked the disk, and mounted it under <em>/Volumes</em>. The next trick was actually getting the data off the disk and onto my external disk. The recovery environment is very bare bones, there was no intention of using it as a file manager. The easiest thing to do was to rsync my home directory over to my clone disk. Since rsync is not available in the recovery manager, I used the version from my cloned disk, so the command looked something like this:</p>
<pre><code>/Volumes/Flux/usr/bin/rsync -avz /Volumes/Prime/Users/Me/ /Volumes/Flux/Users/Me
</code></pre>
<p>Where Flux is the name of my clone, and Prime is the name of my internal drive.</p>
<p>This effectively cloned only my home directory, saving the source code, college papers, photographs, and everything else I've collected in the two weeks since the last backup. Next, I booted off of my clone drive again, verified that my important stuff was there, including a few pictures I took yesterday morning, and used Disk Utility to wipe my internal drive. Finally, I started SuperDuper! on the clone, and tried to copy the good image back to the internal disk. </p>
<p>Just then the internal drive failed. My problem was not with the 10.7.2 update, it was with the spinning rust inside my Mac. It seems I retrieved the data off of the internal drive just in time.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2011-09-29-Go2_1.3_Release_Notes.html'>Go2 1.3 Release Notes</a></h2>
<p><img src="/images/go_help.png" align="right" /></p>
<p>Most release notes are so dull. A cut and paste list of code changes, new features, and fixed bugs. Go2 version 1.3 certainly contains it's share of fixes and enhancements, but this is Farmdog, so Go2's release notes are more of a story. </p>
<p>1.3 began development shortly after 1.2 was released. 1.2 was solid, so I thought I'd turn my attention to the user interface, and add a feature that I've been wanting for a long time, the ability to organize my bookmarks with smart folders. However, The existing interface of Go2 was going to need a major overhaul for smart folders to make any sense, so I went to work refining and expanding the main window. It would be wrong not to mention that I've drawn inspiration from both <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id409789998?mt=12">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/">Sparrow</a>, not to mention <a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/">LittleSnapper</a>. </p>
<p>Along the way I found a few annoying bugs that were present in 1.2 that I've now fixed in 1.3. For example, the "Add Bookmark" and "Edit Bookmark" dialogs are now using the same panel, where before they used two different panels. Little things like that led to duplication of code, which invariably leads to mistakes. I also experimented with ideas, some of which led to some great improvements. One of which was a new bookmark wizard. The wizard was, in my opinion, very nice. It walked you through creating a bookmark one step at a time, asking first for the protocol scheme, then the host, and then the path, and optionally a username and password combination. It was all nicely animated, and I loved it. </p>
<p>Then, someone who knows far better than I said "When you think to your self, 'I should make a wizard', slap yourself and then dont". He was right, Go2 is a professional's tool, professionals that I'm marketing to don't need a wizard, they need speed and tools that don't make them think. So, I took his advice and instead added the ability for Go2 to pre-populate the new bookmark field if it finds a URL in your clipboard. So, if you copy a URL from someone else, switch to Go2 and hit Command-N, the URL you just copied will be there. It works great, and its a feature that Go2 would not have had if it were not for the wizard. </p>
<p>Next were the smart folders, and the outline view that they live in. I used an <a href="https://github.com/Perspx/PXSourceList">open source project</a> to build the outline view, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. However, it did take a lot of work and several versions before it finally turned out right. I won't get into all the details here, but the smart folders almost drove me nuts. </p>
<p>Another feature that was far more difficult than it should have been was the center information button. The function of the button was not hard, but I spent weeks getting the look of it just right. I finally was able to use an icon that one of my awesome <a href="http://www.sause.at/">beta testers</a> created for me, and it couldn't be more perfect. I probably went through fifteen iterations of that button. </p>
<p>Come to think of it, the addition of buttons has been something that I have tried to avoid at all costs. I really hope I've hit just the right balance of usability and aesthetic appeal. </p>
<p>Towards what I was thinking should have been the end of the beta cycle, I simply became overloaded with things to do. I talk about it at length in my article <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/07-09-2011/The_Experiment.html">The Experiment</a>, but in June Farmdog went on hiatus until I finish my Masters degree at Iowa State. I put away the code, and focused on my family, my day job, and my classwork, and took a break from development for a few months. I miss developing on a regular basis, but this is a necessity. Last month, I learned that Apple was going to require all App Store applications to be sandboxed. I had some time, I knew Go2 1.3 was nearly complete, so I once again dug out Xcode and decided to ship 1.3. </p>
<p>I knew from before that Go2 ran fine on 10.7, but what I did not expect was that my reliance on one third party tool, <a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/shortcut/">ShortcutRecorder</a>, was going to cause me so much pain. Xcode 4 does not allow Interface Builder plugins, so I spent several days getting all the right pieces in all the right places so Go2 would compile cleanly. Lesson learned, no more frameworks, it's write it myself or it doesn't ship. The next version of Go2 will not have ShortcutRecorder. </p>
<p>Despite the initial problems with compiling Go2 on Lion, Go2 is now updated, clean, and runs great. I've fixed the bugs that were preventing me from shipping it earlier. I've been using it at home and at work for months now, and I'm happy to ship it. Go2 is sandboxed, so its data now lives in <code>~/Library/Containers/com.farmdog.go2/data</code>. If you want to integrate Go2 with Quicksilver (which is what I do), export the bookmarks for Spotlight indexing, and have Quicksilver index <code>~/Library/Containers/com.farmdog.go2/Data/Documents/Go2Data</code>. Works like a charm. </p>
<p>I do not expect any problems with the new release, but if you see any, please let me know and I'll be happy to do my best to make it right. I am still in school for another three semesters, and Farmdog is still officially on hiatus, but I'll be adding small fixes here and there to Go2 as I have time.</p>
<p>The final lesson I've learned from 1.3 is to stop making major changes in minor point releases. 1.3 will be the last such release, point releases beginning with 1.4 will be very minor changes, with any new features or major modifications being worked into version 2.0.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy Go2 version 1.3, and I truly hope it makes your day just a little bit easier. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Others have already said so much about Steve Jobs stepping down as the CEO of Apple that I had serious doubts about adding my voice to the existing cacophony. Others have written so much, and surely so much more will be over the next few days. I had doubts, but I have this to say:</p>
<p>Apple is a reflection of Steve Jobs, a reflection of his aesthetic taste, his preference for design, and his uncompromising demand for quality in everything bearing the Apple logo. This dedication to creating the best polarized the tech community into a group of a few who understood his passion, and a much larger group of detractors who love to point out each and every misstep Apple has taken. Steve Jobs is the best because he would accept nothing less. Not from himself, not from those he worked with, and not from the products his company created. </p>
<p>This is good. </p>
<p>To be uncompromising today means going against the tide, it means pushing boulders up hill. It means ignoring everyone else who says that what you are trying to do is impossible, that you ask too much, that you should simply not care. American industry outside of Apple seems perfectly content to punch a clock, make a paycheck, and watch the hours drone by till the weekend comes and they can drown their atrophied ambitions in alcohol. That is not my job. No skin off my back. Two tears in a bucket.</p>
<p>Mac OS X drew me to Apple because of its Unix core. Since then, I have studied psychology, design, typography, and am now earning a masters degree in the Human Computer Interaction. I do not think it hyperbole to say that Apple, in a way, affected my life. More than anything, what I have learned from watching Apple for the past decade is that not only is it OK to strive for excellence, it is in this striving that you find success. </p>
<p>Half-ass is not good enough.  </p>
<p>Those who do not care will always surround you, those who will try to belittle you and find fault in anything you do. Do not let them drag you down. Stand out, believe, care, and bring a Mac to work.</p>
<p>So, thank you Steve. Thank you for making your life a story that we can look up to. Thank you for creating, building, failing, believing, and succeeding.</p>

<p>Every so often I get the inkling to make this site more than what it is. Since 2008 I've been writing fairly regularly here about whatever comes to mind, and in doing so I've covered several topics. I've written about <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/11-07-2010/Android-Marketplace.html">Android</a> and <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/01-27-2011/Keyboard_Driven_Safari.html">Mac geekery</a>, <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/01-16-2011/from_zero_to_the_app_store.html">success</a> and <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/07-09-2011/The_Experiment.html">failure</a> in Mac development, <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/03-11-2011/Dazzle_Them_With_Science.html">business</a>, <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/10-10-2010/Clean-and-Clutter-Free.html">psychology</a>, <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/10-09-2009/Linux_Hidden_ARP.html">systems administration</a>, personal <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/03-25-2007/change-and-blessing.html">stories</a>, and <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/10-01-2010/The-Smell-of-Salt.html">memories</a>. More than anything, I have tried to <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/02-15-2011/Be_Great.html">inspire</a> others, and sometimes, if I'm very, very lucky, I <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/09-10-2008/on-graduation-day.html">succeed</a>. </p>
<p>From time to time something I've written gets linked to by someone unexpected, and sometimes I get linked to because I've emailed someone to show them the site. These spikes in readers tells me that what I write can be interesting, at least part of the time, but the pattern is haphazard. Probably as haphazard and random as the topics I've covered. I think that this range of topics is what discourages readers from returning to jonathanbuys.com, at least outside of those that know me personally.     </p>
<p>For a long time, I simply did not care how many people read the site. I did not collect statistics or hit counts, and the only metric I had for measuring the popularity (or lack thereof) of the site was email and Twitter responses. Lately though I've been wondering why I keep the site at all, if not for people to read it. Part of me wants to answer that the easy way and say that it is simply a developers journal, a place to rant about whatever my latest complaint is about this language or that syntax. That's not the truth though. If it were, the main topic of the site would be development, and it is clearly not. Another reason is to maintain a sort of "online resume" for potential job offers. Keeping an online persona for employers is an interesting idea, and I would certainly not be against anyone looking through the site to try to get to know me better, but as a sole purpose I think the online resume could be done better in a different format. A much older reason I had for keeping the site was just to practice writing. An idea worth exploring.  </p>
<p>To be able to write coherently, you must first be able to organize your thoughts, feelings, and emotions. In the 37 Signals book "Getting Real", the authors say to <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch08_Wordsmiths.php">hire the better writer</a>, because good writing is the sign of an organized mind. Writing is exercise for the mind. If watching TV is eating potato chips, writing is lifting weights. However, writing for practice does not mean that you have to share. If practicing writing was my only motivation, I would have no need for a website. A personal journal would do. So, why do I keep publishing? Why do I keep working on the site? </p>
<p>Mostly, its hope. I will be deep, bare-bones honest with you here. It is hope that maybe, just maybe, the site will turn into something more, or lead to something more. I publish here because I hope that something I love to do, writing, can lead to opportunities I cannot foresee. I write here for the same reasons I started Farmdog, the same reasons I went back to grad school... hope. Still, hope and $2.02 will get you a medium cup of coffee at <a href="http://smokeyrow.com/">Smokey Row</a>. It is not enough to hope. To make anything real you must take action. To take action, you need direction, to have direction, you must have a plan. Me, I'm a planner.</p>
<p>Going back to the idea of writing being the sign of an organized mind, I honestly did not know how this article was going to end until I started writing it. In the writing, my mind worked through the reasoning and logic, aligning things I knew into a cohesive story. A story that starts being more focused on the topics I write about, and thinking more about the reader than myself. I don't know how I'm going to say I'm writing to be a writer without sounding like an asshole, but I'm going to do my best. </p>

<p>The Motorola ATRIX 4G is technology released before its time. At first glance, it seems like any other Android phone with impressive technical specs and questionable user interface decisions, but the phone as a phone is not the interesting part of this device. </p>
<p><a href="/media/atrix4g.png"><img src="/media/atrix4g_thumb.png" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The phone can be docked to what appears to be a notebook, and used as an (almost) full-fledged computer. Motorola (soon to be Google?) calls this a "<a href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/WEBTOP/Meet-WEBTOP">webtop application</a>", and packages a version of Firefox. I would call this technology an early preview of whats to come.</p>
<p>The iPhone changed the mobile phone market. It proved how much a small mobile device could do. Before the iPhone mobile applications were horrible, slow, and expensive. I remember it costing $2.99 per month to play Pac-Man. The disruption caused by the iPhone is still being felt as the market continues to adjust, and innovation continues to leap forward. As the phones become more powerful and more capable, the role of the desktop computer will continue to decrease. Eventually, the big boxes will only be useful to developers and movie makers. The role that they played will be replaced by our phones.</p>
<p>On my desk, as on many others, sits my MacBook Pro (clamshell mode, in a <a href="http://www.twelvesouth.com/products/bookarc/">BookArc</a>, if you were interested), a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and my iPhone in a dock. How long will it be until the MacBook is no longer needed? How long until all I need is to drop the phone in the dock, my monitor springs to life, and I start working the same as I always have?</p>
<p><em>As a short sidebar, touch based interfaces are wonderful, but I believe that there will be a place for the tactile response of a physical <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/03-29-2011/Keyboards_and_Wheels.html">keyboard</a> for a long time to come.</em></p>
<p>A brief look at the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/History_of_computers">history of computers</a> shows a steadily declining physical size, and a steadily increasing amount of power. I do not believe that this trend shows any sign of slowing. For example, recent <a href="http://www.zurich.ibm.com/news/11/pcm.html">research by IBM</a> shows great promise in increasing the amount of, and reliability of, local flash storage. How long will it be until both the raw computational power and local storage in a phone both match what is available in a notebook computer? </p>
<p>The form factor of a notebook computer is a good trade off. There is ample screen resolution, and a full sized keyboard for serious work, and it is portable enough so you can comfortably sit on your couch to get things done. However, it does not pass the pocket test. That is, you can't fit one in your pocket... unless you have freakishly large pockets. But, what about a notebook sized device with a keyboard, monitor, and touchpad that you could slide your phone into like you load a CD now? What if you could take that same phone and dock it on your desk to use as your main desktop computer. What if you could bring it with you anywhere, and have everything with you, anywhere you had a pocket?</p>
<p>The ATRIX is clearly a step in that direction, but it is too little, too soon. The ATRIX is more of a curiosity than a real consumer device that people would be expected to use on a daily basis. I explored one at a local BestBuy for a while, and found the user interface to be laggy, slow to respond to mouse events. It felt like using old emulation software. I can not imagine why anyone would choose to use the device as it is, the hardware is simply not ready. However, slow hardware is a temporary problem. The ATRIX is a glimpse of the future. </p>

<p>My daughter had an ear infection. A common occurrence in children, so I brought her down to our local doctors office. The doctor took one look at her ear and knew what needed to be done. He wrote out a prescription, gave me a few instructions, and sent me on my way. I then had two choices, I could drive the twenty miles into the city to get her prescription filled by Walgreens, or I could drive seven miles over to the next town to see if the local pharmacy could take care of it. I decided on the shorter trip.</p>
<p>Walking into the pharmacy in the next town I felt a bit like McFly in Back to the Future. The front of the store is segregated by a few short isles of various ointments and creams, heartburn treatment and special insoles for shoes. Towards the center of the store is a small cafe serving soda and malts. The pharmacy is at the back of the store, adorned by relics of its past: an antique cash register, mortar and pestle, weights and scales, and an assortment of glass bottles that once contained the popular medicines of their times.</p>
<p>I walked to the counter and asked the teenager if they could fill the prescription. She looked at the slip and the doctor's scrawl, asked if I had been there before, and went to ask the advice of the woman in the back. She soon returned and said that it would be just a few moments, and that the other woman was working on the prescription now. I walked around the shop a bit longer, taking note of the blood pressure testing machine and the variety of bandages on the shelf, and was soon called to the counter by the woman who had prepared the medicine. </p>
<p>After I paid the copay, I told her how glad I was that the little pharmacy was there. She smiled, said thank you, and then did something unexpected. She said, that since I have children, and that children sometimes got sick in the middle of the night, that she would give me both her home phone and her cell phone numbers on the back of her business card. </p>
<p>The woman was both the pharmacist and the owner of the little corner store, and the great-granddaughter of the man who opened the store over one hundred years ago. On the drive home I reflected on the choice I had made to visit the small town instead of the city, and it occurred to me what a difference in quality of service there was. Not only was the smaller store closer, I came away with more than expected. I could have easily lost two hours driving to the city, and had little to no interaction with the people mixing the medicine. The transaction could have been dry and remote, but was instead warm and personal. It felt good to know who I was dealing with, that they had a concern for the welfare of my children, and that I was supporting the local community.</p>
<p>Chain stores have increasingly replaced the small town, family owned store, and that is a shame. People stand to gain so much more by shopping locally. I now have the pharmacists home and cell numbers on our family bulletin board at home, and an assurance that I could call anytime, day or night. The personal touch she added to our business today is the essence of personal quality.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2011-08-04-Text_Editing_in_MacVim.html'>Text Editing in MacVim</a></h2>
<p>The venerable BBEdit recently received a <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html">big upgrade</a>, and looks poised to attract users of TextMate, which, by all accounts, has been abandoned by its developer. I tried to love BBEdit, but it always felt like trying on someone else&#8217;s clothes. They might look good, but that does not mean the clothes will be comfortable for you. Recent conversations about text editors on <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze">Build and Analyze</a> led me to rethink my position, and examine in more detail how I came to choose MacVim.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I was sitting with a contractor as he installed a new firewall on our network. He was explaining to me how Unix systems relied on text files, and how all Unix systems came with a text editor named <em>vi</em>. I asked, in my ignorance, why anyone should bother using such ancient technology, when a modern graphical text editor was available. Pragmatically, he replied that someday I would be connected to a server through SSH or telnet and the only way to edit a file would be with vi. I took his advice to heart, and I am glad I did.</p>
<p>Over the years as I have dug deeper and deeper into Unix (and later Linux) systems, I accumulated a few of my favorite vi tricks which I kept in an exrc file. I had complicated macros that would do things like building the skeleton of a shell script, or insert a comment with my name and email address, or the current date. OK, maybe it was not that complicated, but every time I hit the mapped key combo, I smiled. I learned to navigate to an exact line in a file, to yank and paste text, and generally how to get along with the only text editor I could be sure was on each and every server I was responsible for. I did not realize it at the time, but I was building up valuable expertise, and, it seems, more importantly, a type of muscle memory. </p>
<p>In the past, I always kept my work on the servers separate from my &#8220;work&#8221; I did on my Mac. My Mac was a hobby, but work was important. When TextMate appeared, I downloaded a copy to use for building web sites. I enjoyed TextMate, but there was never love. Love takes time, frustration, and understanding. Love was what I was building at work with vi. I simply did not understand it at the time.</p>
<p>In fact, for many years I kept the attitude that vi was not a modern text editor. It was simply a tool for work and that on a Mac I should be able to use a graphical text editor that did lots of fancy tricks. It was not until this summer, after years of building my vi knowledge on the server that I decided to use vi for a Python programming course on my Mac. I downloaded a copy of <a href="https://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a>, spent a few days configuring it the way I liked it, and, for what feels like the first time, felt completely comfortable in my text editor.</p>
<p>I had already overcome the biggest obstacle to vi: the learning curve. Slowly, over years of use, I had become fluent in one of the most powerful text editors available. </p>
<p>I will not go into the details of how to configure MacVim, there are several articles for that already. If you are interested, I keep my MacVim configuration in <a href="https://github.com/ibuys/My-MacVim-Config">GitHub</a>. What I will say is that taking the time to learn the basics of vi, and taking a few days, maybe a week, to find the magic combination of plugins and configurations that work for you, is worth the effort. MacVim is like a gateway drug. Once you get used to using it, you might find yourself attempting to navigate a new email in Mail with vi key bindings.</p>
<p>I am still learning new things with MacVim. There are precious few tricks that another editor can do that MacVim cannot. However, choosing MacVim is akin to choosing a partner to share your life. The more you put into the relationship, the more you get out of it. In any relationship, over time you become aware of the others shortcomings, but if the relationship is healthy, those shortcomings are very easy to overlook. If you spend serious time in text, it behooves you to spend serious time learning your tools.   </p>
<p>MacVim is actively developed, has a dedicated community, is easily extendible, and can fly through the biggest text files with ease. However, it does take time to understand, and I will not try to tell you that the commands you use to control MacVim are intuitive or &#8220;easy&#8221;. Nothing worth doing is ever easy.</p>

<p>OS X Lion is a big step forward in personal computing, and, over the next few years, we are going to see a lot of our preconceptions about how computers work begin to melt away. Apple is setting a high bar for themselves and their developers. Lion is an ambitious release with ambitious goals that are going to take some time to actually come to fruition. However, as futuristic as Lion is, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/mission-control.html">Mission Control</a> feels like a step back.</p>
<p><a href="/media/mission_control.jpg"><img class="center" src="/media/mission_control_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>One of the best features of the Mac since 10.3 been Exposé. Exposé became a part of my workflow so easily that I came to rely on it just by muscle memory. Exposé was always one of the gems of OS X that highlighted how different the mental model of using the computer was when compared to Windows. Unfortunately, with Lion, Apple decided to cut way back on the features that were available in Exposé and mash it together with Spaces. Spaces are Apple's implementation of multiple desktops, a feature that UNIX and Linux desktops of had for decades. Spaces before 10.7 was fairly good, but I rarely used it. </p>
<p>One situation when I would use Spaces is during server patching. When patching servers it would not be unusual to have 20 or even 30 different terminal windows open at the same time, as well as a chat window, Mail, and Safari. With that many windows open at the same time I would use Exposé to keep track of them all, and I would use Spaces to keep all of the different terminal groups in their own space. On Snow Leopard and before you could activate Spaces, and then drag windows back and forth between Spaces even if you weren't actually on the desktop that was active at the time. It didn't matter, they were all equal. </p>
<p>Then, using Spaces' 10,000 ft. view, you could see all of your Spaces, and all of your overlapping windows. It is interesting to note that this core functionality has not changed in Mission Control. Mission Control does still let you see all Spaces and all overlapping windows in them. In Exposé, the magic was that you could then hit the key command for Exposé and inside of each one of the Spaces, in real time, the windows would all zoom out into Exposé in each of their Spaces to give you a full view of every window in every space that you had opened. Exposé allowed you to drag-and-drop your individual windows between Spaces and watch as the windows in the new space automatically resized and rearranged to make room for the new arrival.</p>
<p>Mission control is almost Exposé; it does give you the ability to see different application windows, but what it takes away is the elegance of Exposé. Instead of a set of miniaturized windows, each a small, live updating thumbnail, mission control overlaps windows from the same application. Worse, applications windows overlap in the order they were used, which is wrong. If you think about it, when you are going into Exposé, you don't want to see the application window you just used, you want to see the window that was active before you began using the window that you are currently in. I have always used Exposé to switch between tasks, not to switch between applications.</p>
<p>Also gone from Mission Control is the live nature of Spaces. You can only interact with the space you are currently in, you cannot interact with any other open space, except to switch to that space. That is a step back, no matter how you look at.</p>
<p>I can understand why some things needed to change and Spaces. In Lion, the three finger swipe gesture between Spaces would not have worked with Snow Leopard's implementation of Spaces. With Snow Leopard, Spaces occupied a two-dimensional graph, both horizontal and vertical. Spaces could be either up or down, or left or right. In Lion, Spaces are only horizontal. This works because the best way to move between Spaces is the three finger swipe from left to right, or from right to left. On Snow Leopard Spaces, to be able to use gestures, you would also have to be able to recognize a three finger swipe up for the space above, and a three finger swipe down for the space below. In Lion, those gestures are already accounted for. Not to say that it could not work, but I could see users becoming easily disoriented as to which space they were in, and which way they should be swiping. With Mission Control, when you reach the end of available Spaces, the desktop bounces slightly, a move clearly reminiscent of iOS. However, what does not make sense to me why Apple decided to change Exposé in a way that is clearly inferior. </p>
<p>With that being said, I love the three-finger swipe gesture to activate Mission Control, but I do wish I could see the full Exposé. I find myself using Spaces a more now than I ever did before. I do not use them as additional desktops but I do always have a space open for iCal, another for iTunes, and maybe another for mail. It's good to see improvements in Spaces, but it is unfortunate the improvements had to come the cost of the most sophisticated window management system on any platform.</p>

<p>Since writing <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/01-27-2011/Keyboard_Driven_Safari.html">Keyboard Driven Safari</a> I've updated my list of extensions that make Safari my browser of choice.</p>
<ul>

<li><strike><a href="http://langui.sh/safari-extensions/">Optimize Legibility</a></strike>
<em>update: Optimize Legibility seems to have some performance issues. My Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/oldmanuk">Dominic Evans</a> for pointing this out.</em></li>
<li><a href="http://davidbenjones.com/">Beautipedia</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dbergey.github.com/">Type-To-Navigate</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dbergey.github.com/">Invisible Status Bar</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of shutup.css, YouTube5, and uTube makes for a great experience viewing videos on YouTube. No comments, a very nicely centered layout, and high-quality 720p h.264 video. Beautifier and Optimize Legibility are both very small, and insert some simple css into each page to enhance typography and font rendering for a better reading experience on sites that may not think of these things on their own. </p>
<p>When reading a Wikipedia article on my MacBook, the experience is similar to using Instapaper  on my iPad, thanks to Beautipedia. Absolutely gorgeous. I'm not entirely sure I need Incognito, but the idea of being tracked by some gigantic, faceless corporate entity just feels wrong. Incognito blocks Google Adsense and Google Analytics, as well as Facebook tracking. </p>
<p>The next two extensions are new to the list: Type-To-Navigate and Invisible Status Bar, both by Daniel Bergey. Type-To-Navigate lets me type the characters in a link, and hit the return key to "click" the link. Previous to installing this extension, I would use the Safari "find" feature to quickly find a specific link on a page, and then click on the link with the mouse. Type-To-Navigate removes two steps from the process, and the results are fantastic.</p>
<p>Invisible Status Bar borrows from Chrome, and allows me to hide the status bar, while still being able to hover over a link to see the full URL. Very nice to have when reading through long text, and deciding if a link is worth following or not. </p>
<p>The last extension I use is the fantastic <a href="http://agilebits.com/products/1Password">1Password</a>. 1Password is the one of the first three apps I install on a new Mac, and the first I install on a new iOS device. </p>
<p>Dropped from the list is Google Search Cleanup. I've switched most of my search to <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>, thanks to outstanding keyboard navigation (it supports vi keyboard bindings for navigation). DuckDuckGo is a very small operation taking on giants, I can't help but root for the underdog. </p>

<p>Apple makes great products, and Brooks Brothers makes great clothes, but neither make the man. It is pure foolishness to judge another person at all, much less using a measure as trifling as a choice of computer.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2011-07-18-Letter_to_Lotus_Notes_Developers.html'>Letter to Lotus Notes Developers</a></h2>
<p>I have some issues with the design of Lotus Notes. I'm a relatively new user, I started using Notes in 2006, and at the time we were using 6.5 on Windows. I've since upgraded to 8.5.2 on Mac OS X. </p>
<p>The very first thing that strikes me is the default "new mail sound" on the Mac:</p>
<p><audio controls="controls">
  <source src="/media/Lotus_New_Mail.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  <source src="/media/Lotus_New_Mail.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio></p>
<p>Now, imagine hearing that sound several times a day. I eventually got tired of having my Mac muted, and copied the new mail sound out of Mail.app and into Lotus Notes. Here is how it sounds now:  </p>
<p><audio controls="controls">
  <source src="/media/Mac_New_Mail.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  <source src="/media/Mac_New_Mail.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio></p>
<p>Much better. The original sounds like a carousel at a carnival or something. I would love to hear the rational behind that sound.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are preferences. Lots and lots of preferences, spread all over the place. Each day I start Notes at work, and someone will send me a link to a web site. I’ll click on that link, and each day an error will pop up saying “Unable to launch program”. I click “OK”, and then remember that I need to set my default browser in the Notes preferences. That is not a design issue, that is just buggy software. The design issue here is where I need to go to find the preference to change the default web browser.</p>
<p>On a Mac, all well designed applications’ preferences can be opened by pressing the key combination “Command + ,”. Notes also recognizes that key combo, but only opens a subset of the available preferences called “User Preferences”. The User Preferences are also available under a submenu named “Preferences” under the main Lotus Notes menu. In addition to the User Preferences, there are also menu options for Toolbar Preferences and Status Bar Preferences. Each menu option opens up a similar looking window with a plethora of options for changing different aspects of Notes’ appearance or functionality. None of the options change the default browser.</p>
<p>Under the “File” menu, where only functions relevant to the currently opened document should appear, there are four more menus leading to submenus for additional preferences: Application, Replication, Locations, and Instant Messaging. Under the Locations menu, there is a submenu option to "Manage Locations". This opens a new tab in front of the mail applications tab in the main window of Lotus Notes. Double-clicking on “Online” opens up a third tab with options defining how my Lotus Notes client connects to the Lotus Notes server. This tab has sub-tabs. The fourth sub-tab over is labeled “Internet Browser”. Clicking on this tab shows a screen with one option for choosing the web browser. Double clicking on the name of the browser, or clicking on the edit button towards the top left hand corner of the locations tab will show a drop down menu. Clicking on the drop down menu does not drop down a menu, but opens up another window where I can then choose the default browser. Then, I need to click “Save &amp; Close”, close the Locations tab, and then I’ll be able to click on the link.</p>
<p>This is completely unnecessary. Mac OS X keeps the default browser settings, so all an external application needs to do is pass a URL to OS X (via the NSFileManager class, if you are into Obj-C), and the OS will launch the appropriate application to handle the protocol.</p>
<p>This doesn't even begin to get into other standard Mac practices like pressing Command-N to start a new email (Notes tries to create a new application?), the lack of spotlight integration, or the fact that none of the controls are standard controls. No syncing with Address Book or iCal, and the text fields do not inherit the standard NSTextField or NSTextView functionality. The UI is literally surrounded by buttons. Lotus Notes is a very powerful application, but all I want to do is check my email and calendar. Every now and again I use it to send a time-off request. </p>
<p>I understand that Notes has a long history, and I understand that it is a cross-platform application. I've also read the paper(<a href="http://www.notesdesignblog.com/NotesDesignBlog/NDBlog.nsf/dx/cs148-comstock2.pdf/$file/cs148-comstock2.pdf">pdf</a>) on the redesign of Notes, and commend the team on bringing Notes this far. However, I believe the application has a long way to go, assuming a goal of Lotus Notes is to be a viable mail application on Mac OS X, and not just what the company forces the user to use. </p>
<p>I'm willing to help in any way I can.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2011-07-13-Found_On_The_Path.html'>Found On The Path</a></h2>
<p>I woke this morning at 5:20, got dressed, and went outside for my morning
workout. Today's weather was beautiful, perfect temperature, and the smell of
fresh rain. Lately I've been riding my bike, a Schwinn that is neither strong
enough to be a mountain bike, nor sleek enough to be a road bike. I would call
it a "small town bike", as it gets me around all four corners of our small
town.</p>
<p>I rode down the street, fast down the slight decline, feeling the wind on my
cheeks, blowing the last of the sleep from my mind. I slowed down a little
going up a slight incline, starting the muscles in my legs working for the day.
Across the highway, down a few cross roads, until I came to the city park,
my favorite part of the ride. The park has a small pond with a path around it
and a bridge over it. Sometimes I see frogs jump into the pond, and twice now
I've seen a large bird I believe to be a stork on the far side of the pond.</p>
<p>As I rode around the pond I was distracted by something in the path, something
fairly large. Large enough that I was sure it was not supposed to be here. This
was unusual. As I rode closer I saw that it was a blanket. My first thought was
"why would someone leave a blanket out here". As I rode closer I began to think
that it was shaped oddly like a man.</p>
<p>My thoughts raced back to New Mexico, where I found a man, drunk, lying in the
street. He was unconscious, and looked as if he had fallen face-first into a
busy city street off the curb at a bus stop. His companions at the bus stop
simply looked at him, and continued to wait for the bus. I was driving by on
the way to work, but stopped to help.</p>
<p>Gliding by the oddly man shaped blanket I glanced down at it and thought I
caught a glimpse of skin under the blanket. I stopped my bike, got off a few
feet past it, and could see a bare foot uncovered. I started to feel anxious.
There was someone there. I took a small step towards the blanket, thinking
about what I would do if it were a homeless man sleeping. I had decided to step
up to the blanket and ask if whoever was inside needed help. If it were a hobo,
he'd probably say no and yell at me to leave him alone. I did not want to get
yelled at, but I also did not want to leave someone if they needed help. </p>
<p>I looked again at the foot, and something about it struck me as odd. Even a
hobo would probably have shoes, and this foot looked oddly clean, well kept,
and small. A horrible thought ran through my head, something worthy of the
opening scene from a prime time crime drama on TV. All of these thoughts raced
through my head in the course of a few seconds as I took another step towards
the blanket. Then, the blanket was thrown back, and a voice greeted me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What's up? Did you think we were dead?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course. Under the blanket were a pair of teenagers. A boy with a bright,
fake diamond earring, and a girl with pink hair. I have a feeling I know what
they were up to under there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wasn't sure."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I replied.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Naw, just chilling."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Said the boy.</p>
<p>The girl giggled. Feeling slightly embarrassed at interrupting their ill placed
chilling, I looked at the pond, then looked at the sky, then said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nice place."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then got back on my bike and continued on the path.</p>
<p>Another mile down the road I saw two rabbits.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2011-07-09-The_Experiment.html'>The Experiment</a></h2>
<h3>The Experiment</h3>
<p><em>Ideas, Stress, and Time</em></p>
<p>I remember someone saying once that ideas were worthless, and only
implementation mattered. I disagree. Ideas have power, and depending on who
you are, that power can be used to either create, or destroy. Or, in my case,
both. When I get an idea, the drive to make that idea become reality can
consume me. I may do nothing about it for days, weeks, or even months, and
then, seemingly suddenly, put all of my time and energy into it in one big
explosion. During the time leading up to the creation phase, I'm thinking. At
night while I drift off to sleep, during the day when there is a lull in my
work flow, during all the little times that something else is not occupying my
cognitive functions, I'm thinking about my idea. I consider the idea, I poke
it and prod it from as many different angles as I can until I get to a point
where I know how to make it real. Or, at least as real as my limited knowledge
base can facilitate.</p>
<p>My problem with the thinking/creating loop is that what I'm thinking about and
what I'm creating may not be what's best for me at the time. The offset
between what I <em>should</em> be thinking about and what I actually <em>am</em> thinking
about creates unnecessary stress in my life, and makes it harder to
concentrate on things that I need to be concentrating on, when I need to be
concentrating on them. Having an idea that may lead to the accomplishment of a
life-long goal is a wonderful thing, if the idea comes at a time when a person
can actually act on it without neglecting other commitments. Unfortunately,
that is not the situation that I find myself in now.</p>
<p><em>Masters</em></p>
<p>Last Fall I enrolled in the Masters of Human-Computer Interaction program at
Iowa State University. When I finish this semester I'm in the middle of right
now, I'll be at the half-way point. The program is entirely online, so I can
continue to work at my day job as a systems administrator while I work at
night on my assignments. The course load is more than I was expecting, and the
course work takes far more time than I thought I would need. I spend several
hours on the weekends, and several nights each week studying. Some classes
have been a lot of fun, others have felt like pushing a bolder up a hill. I'm
lucky enough right now to have two classes that I'm enjoying, one on
programming in Python, and another on the fundamentals of design.</p>
<p>My hope for the Masters degree is that it will lead to exciting new
opportunities in the future. Something that my experience as a systems
administrator alone would not. While I enjoy my work, I feel like I could do
more, and I do not feel like it is ultimately going to fulfill that life-long
goal I was referring to above.</p>
<p>So, I work during the day, and I go to school at night. In between times I try
my best to be a good husband and father to my family. We have four kids, and
they all need time with Dad. So, we do stuff, fishing, roller-coasters, bike
rides, cooking… lots of stuff. Stuff that, really, is more important than
anything else. The kind of stuff that gives me a reason to get up in the
morning.</p>
<p>My obligations to my family are clear, as are my obligations to my employer,
as well as my obligations to Iowa State. However, grad school was not the only
thing I started last Fall. I also started <a href="http://farmdogapps.com">Farmdog
Software</a>.</p>
<p><em>Farmdog</em></p>
<p>Everyone is busy, everyone has obligations, and no one is going to think that
I've taken on too much, especially those who have started successful software
companies. What I've told myself for the past nine months is to just suck it
up and keep working. Long after everyone else is asleep, I've stayed up to
keep working on Go2 and Farmdog. Unfortunately, as Dan Benjamin recently said
on <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/23">Back to Work</a>, you can't start a successful
business part time. It needs your full attention, you need to be committed to
it.</p>
<p>Farmdog Software has been my dream for a long time. Since first working with
my mentor back in England, and learning how he started a successful consulting
business, I've wanted to work for myself. I've been dreaming of working out of
my home for twelve years, and my hope with Farmdog was that it would be the
catalyst that would finally help me achieve that dream. It has not. It is
entirely my fault. I see where I've made mistakes, and how my timing was
completely off. Underestimating how much time it would take to run the
business, and how much time it would take to go to grad school has left me me
stressed, unhappy, and <em>drained</em>. My family, my boss, and I all deserve better
than that.</p>
<p>Being stretched this thin caused the quality of my work to go down. The most
recent build of Go2, 1.3, has glaring bugs that make it unusable for me. While
I love my beta testers, and seriously can not thank them enough for finding
the faults in Go2, I can not, in good conscience, release 1.3 as it is. It
needs a major reworking, and some serious thought into its direction and what
it does. I still use it every day at work to launch SSH sessions, which is
what I built it for, but I need to think through what the best direction of it
as a product is. It needs the kind of thought that I just don't have the
ability to give it right now.</p>
<p>So, Go2 1.3 is not going to be submitted to the App Store. Farmdog Software is
going on hiatus until I finish Grad School next year.</p>
<p>Farmdog has been an experiment of sorts, I wanted to see if I could do it, if
I could become an "indie developer". I accomplished what I set out to do, but
not well, and not with the kind of dedication the endeavor deserved. As an
experiment, we will call Farmdog a success, and a proof of concept that, given
the appropriate time and attention, Farmdog can lead to accomplishing my goal.
However, right now is not the time. Right now is the time to concentrate on
finishing my Masters degree.</p>
<p><em>The Future</em></p>
<p>I have many ideas for apps, many that I'd love to start building right now,
but they are going to have to wait. While Farmdog is going on hiatus, it is
<strong>not being abandoned</strong>. When I finish my Masters degree, I am going to return
to Cocoa with everything I can muster. I am going to leave Go2 in the App
Store, it generates one or two sales a week, and if people find it useful I
see no reason not to let them have it. So far support has not been an issue,
but if it becomes one I'll pull it. Farmdog is going to stay alive, simply in
a holding pattern until I return.</p>
<p>I want to make clear how much I appreciate everyone who's helped beta test
Go2, and how much I appreciate the (very few) customers I've been lucky enough
to have. If you are one of the awesome few who've purchased Go2, I seriously
can not thank you enough. You've helped make the experiment a success, and
given me a direction for the future. If Go2 had not sold at all, or if it had
been given a bunch of negative reviews, I probably would have decided my
future lay elsewhere.</p>
<p>For the CocoaHeads in Des Moines (and in Cupertino), thank you as well. It's
great to know that there's a group of people in the area who are willing to
help, and to share what they've learned.</p>
<p>As I write this, I feel relieved, but the real burden was lifted as soon as I
made the decision two days ago. As much as I like to think that I'm superman,
I really have only a limited set of abilities, and something had to go.</p>

<p>Daring Fireball linked to Paul Thurrott today, citing Paul's comment that Lion is simply an evolutionary, rather than revolutionary update. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/06/14/thurrott-ios-5-lion">John says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Mac OS X in particular, to my recollection, Thurrott has had this same take for every single major (i.e., new cat name) release. Every single one, he’s considered to be “minor” and “evolutionary”.</p>

<p>Sounds like fun, let's take a look.    </p>
<p><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/article/product-review/apple-mac-os-x-101-review">Apple Mac OS X 10.1 Review</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft and Apple developed XP and OS X in parallel, and although the first version of OS X (10.0) shipped months ago (in March), the OS wasn't ready for consumers and casual users until 10.1's release in late September.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Thurrott does not specifically say 10.1 was a minor update in this review, he does address it in the 10.3 review.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the course of three minor updates (10.1 in late 2001, 10.2 in late 2002, and now 10.3) Apple has done much to strengthen Mac OS X's underpinnings with a usable fascia that's bursting with functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fascia? and... </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Panther costs a whopping $129 for most Mac OS X users, although customers who have purchased a new Mac since October 8 can get it for free. That's a lot of money to pay for mostly subtle refinements that, arguably, should have been in the system to begin with. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger" is, in fact, a minor upgrade to an already well-designed and rock-solid operating system. It will not change the way you use your computer at all, and instead uses the exact same mouse and windows interface we've had since the first Mac debuted in 1984.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While the Apple hype machine and its fanatical followers would have you believe that Mac OS X 10.5 "Leopard" is a major upgrade to the company's venerable operating system, nothing could be further from the truth. Instead, Leopard is yet another evolutionary upgrade in a long line of evolutionary OS X upgrades, all of which date back to the original OS X release in 2001. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Leopard is an incremental, evolutionary update over the previous release with no major architectural changes, which makes me wonder why Apple is even charging for it: In the Windows world, such releases are called service packs.</p>

</article><article><h2><a href='2011-06-14-Two_Views_Of_The_Cloud.html'>Two Views Of The Cloud</a></h2>
<p>A few years ago, there was a distinction between the "world wide web" and the Internet. The distinction has decreased, but in the wake of Apple's landmark <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/11piubpwiqubf06/event/">WWDC keynote</a>, I think the technical distinction between the terms is an important point to make. The difference between the Internet and the web that rides on top of the Internet forms the basis for two very different points of view for the future of personal computing. </p>
<p>Forgive me as I drastically oversimplify a highly complex system.</p>
<p><em>The Internet</em></p>
<p>I recently had the privilege of speaking at career day at my kids school. When asked if any of them could explain the Internet, the kids gave a few entertaining answers like "that's where the Google is", and "it's where you can find stuff". Although most kids knew what a computer was, none knew that the Internet was a collection of computers of varying sizes. Calling the Internet the "Cloud" further abstracts the reality of what the Internet is from what it is perceived as being. The Internet is an interconnecting of devices, both large and small. Many other systems ride on top of the Internet, like email, file transfer, name mapping, and, most popular of all, the world wide web.</p>
<p><em>The World Wide Web</em></p>
<p>The World Wide Web uses the hypertext transfer protocol to send hypertext markup language between computers. The markup language is compiled into web pages viewed in a web browser. Web pages contain hypertext links to other web pages, links that branch out like a spider's web, hence the name, World Wide Web, the "www" part of the naming scheme for web sites. </p>
<p>The Web rides on top of the Internet. Companies like Google make money by selling ads on web sites. So, in their view of the Internet, the web is not only the biggest thing, it's the <em>only</em> thing, and the more they can draw you into the web browser, the more money they can make.</p>
<p><em>Who Profits From This</em></p>
<p>Apple's recent announcement of iCloud centers around native applications that run on their devices. This is because Apple makes money from selling Macs, iPhones, iPods, and iPads. Apple makes software to make their hardware more appealing to potential buyers. They are a hardware company. On the other hand, Google is an advertising company. They make software to sell ads. They give away the software for free so they can build a large user base to make their advertising space more appealing to corporations. </p>
<p>In Google's view of the Internet, the "Cloud" is centered on their ability to present the user with ads, therefore the Google view of the Cloud is inside the web browser. Apple, being a hardware company, sees the Cloud as an interconnect between their devices, not a restricted window seen through the web browser. Apple is willing to use the entire Internet to move things around, Google wants to keep you in the browser as much as possible. So much so that they are building an entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome_OS">operating system</a> that is nothing but a web browser.</p>
<p>I should note that I do not know what file transfer mechanisms iCloud uses. It is very possible that they are using protocols that are built on top of http, and are technically higher up the stack, but what I'm trying to address is the conceptual model. Apple's iCloud is device centric, Google's "cloud" is web centric.</p>
<p>In Apple's view of the Cloud, it is entirely possible that eventually a person could forget they were using the Internet at all. The promise of iCloud is that news, messages, emails, documents, pictures, music, and entertainment could be delivered to all of your devices without thinking about it. Eventually, as this technology is refined, it will be more common to live outside of the web browser than inside, a concept I could see ad companies like Google having a problem with. </p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2011-05-19-On-TermKit-|-Steven-Wittens---Acko.net.html'>On TermKit - Steven Wittens</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been administering Unix machines for many years now, and frankly, it kinda sucks. It makes me wonder, when sitting in front of a crisp, 2.3 million pixel display (i.e. a laptop) why I'm telling those pixels to draw me a computer terminal from the 80s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>via: <a href="http://acko.net/blog/on-termkit?page=3">On TermKit | Steven Wittens - Acko.net</a></p>
<p>I too have been administering Unix and Unix-like machines for many years. I admire Steven's ambition, and his obvious programming and design expertise, but I believe his architecture with TermKit is a bit misguided. TermKit is a combination of Cocoa, Node.js, and WebKit, and while it works, there are a lot of moving parts to get it to work. </p>
<p>Steven seems to have missed the point of the command line, and why we are still use it after all these years. I like using a carpenter's analogy. Sometimes, you just need a hammer. Sure, there are framing nailers and powder-actuated guns, but sometimes, the only way to get the job done is to hit something with something else hard and heavy. That's the command line, that's Unix.  </p>
<p>Neal Stephenson uses a better tool analogy. Popping open the Terminal is akin to bringing out the <a href="http://www.team.net/mjb/hawg.html">Hole Hawg</a>, it's ugly, it's powerful, and it gets the job done.</p>
<p>The most basic point for why Terminal.app still exists, and why the command line is still a preferred tool for systems administration is that Unix is a text-based operating system. All of the configuration files are text, much of the system information is available as text, and all input and output from the commands are text. So, when you are operating on the lowest level of the system, reaching for optimum efficiency, the command line gives you direct access. Anything built on top of that is an unnecessary layer of abstraction.  </p>
<p>Being able to "cat" a PDF file is a neat trick, but I have a hard time imagining how it could help revolutionize systems administration.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2011-04-13-Introversion_Intuition_Thinking_Judgement.html'>Introversion Intuition Thinking Judgment</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>INTJs apply (often ruthlessly) the criterion "Does it work?" to everything
from their own research efforts to the prevailing social norms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I first took the Myers-Briggs personality test in the Navy, stationed at the
Defense Threat Reduction Agency in New Mexico. I believe it was some sort of
HR project for the civilians on base that I worked with, and I was asked to
participate as well. I was pleased with the results, and perhaps even a bit
proud of the favorable description. Reading the results I found several
instances where the profile matched or explained past behavior, but truthfully
I wondered if I had unconsciously steered the test in the way that I wanted it
to go. Several months later, I took the test again, and again got the same
results: <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/INTJ">INTJ</a>.
Satisfied after taking the test as honestly as possible, I moved on.</p>
<p>Personality tests attempt to generalize patterns of behavior. Since all people
are unique in their experiences, not everything these tests say will be
accurate. Any attempt to explain behavior should be taken with a very large
grain of salt. Uniqueness is not something we humans like to have in our world
though, so we love to group, categorize, and label people. It is a behavior we
learned in middle school, and extends well into our adult life. Some people
cannot understand others without some sort of grouping context to place them
in, even if the context is grossly inaccurate. Personality tests can be a way
to avoid this conscious or unconscious categorization for managers who want to
understand and effectively communicate with their employees. For individuals
though, and, particularly for me, the tests can provide insight into <em>why I do
the things I do</em>.</p>
<p>The other day Benjamin Brooks, from the excellent <a href="http://brooksreview.net/">Brooks
Review</a>, tweeted the results from a personality test
he had taken. Brooks, like myself, is an
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/BenjaminBrooks/status/55050601888890880">INTJ</a>. The
tweet made me wonder if my personality had changed over the years, and if I
took the test again if I would get the same result. So, I did and so… I am. My
results did not change. The test still classifies me as an INTJ. The test
results were not nearly as important to me as reading portions of the profile
to my wife. The profile embarrassed me by how well fit portions of my life,
particularly in my relationships with friends and family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The emotions of an INTJ are hard to read, and neither male nor female INTJs
are apt to express emotional reactions. At times, INTJs seem cold, reserved,
and unresponsive, while in fact they are almost hypersensitive to signals of
rejection from those they care for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I was a child, I was part of the "Gifted and Talented" project. As part
of the project, I saw a counselor, who did several tests. The counselor
predicted that I would have few friends, but the friends I had would be very
close. The prediction has been very accurate so far. I generally like people,
and try very hard to be polite, but if the person is not deemed by my brain as
being important or relevant somehow, I forget them almost immediately after
meeting. I do not do it to be a jerk; it is just how my mind works. On the
other hand, I still know where my best friend from high school is, and if he
showed up at my doorstep tonight, we would spend the rest of the night getting
caught up.</p>
<p>Having the type of brain that I have makes me very good at some things, like
being a systems administrator. I build and organize large, complex,
intricately interwoven patterns of things. I have the ability to understand
complex technological concepts, and am very good at explaining those concepts
to others. I am very good at teaching, mentoring, and talking with others one
on one. I know what I am good at, but more importantly, I know what I am <em>not</em>
good at. I am not good at informal group meetings or luncheons. I am not good
at the after work meet up at the local bar. I am not good at small talk about
sports or hunting. When considering my interactions with others, it is not
enough to just say, "I'm not good with people", that is inaccurate. I am very
good with people, I am not good with informal social groups of people, because
I do not understand the dynamics of how they work, or how I am expected to
behave. I much prefer a small, quiet coffee.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>INTJs are analytical. Like INTPs, they are most comfortable working alone
and tend to be less sociable than other types. Nevertheless, INTJs are
prepared to lead if no one else seems up to the task, or if they see a major
weakness in the current leadership. They tend to be pragmatic, logical, and
creative. They have a low tolerance for spin or rampant emotionalism. They are
not generally susceptible to catchphrases and do not recognize authority based
on tradition, rank, or title.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That last sentence might seem out of place for me, considering my military
background. My friends from the Navy would know that it hits the nail on the
head. There was more than one Chief I went toe to toe with, and since I was
outranked, I usually lost. I was in the Navy, and I loved the travel and
opportunities it gave me, but I never quite <em>fit</em> in the Navy. Some fit in the
Navy like an old glove; I was more like forcing a round peg in a square hole.
I needed the Navy in my life, and I am proud to have served for the eleven
years that I did, but I was also glad to leave.</p>
<p>It is good to know that even though I have changed over the years, the core of
my personality has not. I still care deeply for my loved ones. I still keep my
space neat, clean, and organized. (As a side note, my parents never had to
tell me to clean my room. I kept it the way I liked it.) What I have learned
in the past few years is how to push myself outside of what I am good at, and
into things that make me uncomfortable or are simply not my strong point. Like
working on home improvement and music, and even saying yes, every now and
again, when asked to go to lunch.</p>
<p>Personality tests are not gospel; they are not the be all and end all of who
you are. However, if you are like me, by taking a test you might be able to
gain some insight into why you do what you do. The test might help you find
your strengths, and identify some weaknesses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most fundamental problem, however, is that INTJs really want
people to make sense.</p>

<p>If you take a moment to look around the room you are in now, what do you see?
Are you surrounded by things that matter, and were built by people who care?
Or, more likely, are you surrounded by mass produced, assembly line, imported
goods that you honestly don't believe will last all that long? I've been
thinking about <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/06-16-2010/quality.html">quality</a>
again, and how it applies to me, to what I do, and how I spend my time.</p>
<p>It started with our washing machine. After seven years, our washing machine
looks like it's on its last legs. Seven years sounds like a long time to have
an appliance, but its really not. When our grandparents bought appliances they
were built to last for thirty years, now they are built to last five. We
called up a repair man who stopped by the house to take a look. He was an
older guy, and didn't bring the right tools for the job, so he just looked at
the machine and told us his view of the model we own. He said that he had just
told a customer that day that his washing machine, same model as ours, was not
worth the cost to fix it, and that it would be cheaper and more economical to
buy a new one. As older people do, he lamented the quality of todays machines,
so I asked him what was being built today that was as good as the machines of
the past.</p>
<p>He looked me in the eye and said "There are none."</p>
<p>The repairman's view of the world has become so pessimistic that he truly
believes that there is nothing built for the common man worth buying. This is
sad, but I believe he's wrong. I believe it in part because I'm typing this on
a MacBook Pro, in my opinion the best computer ever built. The perfect blend
of power and portability, but more than that, an example of manufacturing
excellence. Apple is a company that <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">cares</a>
about details, and they are not alone. I believe we may be at the beginning of
a renaissance of sorts, a return to traditionally crafted goods created by
artisans and engineers.</p>
<p>These people have inspired me to do better, to be more, to remember the
attention to detail that the Navy demanded of me. Take a minute to read these
stories, watch their videos, and see where they are coming from.</p>

Industries</a>.</p>
<p>Staber may very well replace our Maytag washing machine. Its all they do.</p>
<p>We don't have to live in a world where all of our <em>things</em> are replaceable,
where everything around us falls apart after a couple of years of use. We
don't have to live in a world where everything has a computer chip and can't
be fixed if it breaks. We don't have to live surrounded by junk. But that's
what the past thirty years of steadily declining quality of goods has taught
us, it's become a core belief that affects everything we do. We go to work,
and sigh, and think, "here it is, another Monday…", and do what we have to do
until we can go home. Punch the clock, earn a paycheck, who cares if our work
is any good? That's wrong, and it doesn't have to be like that.</p>
<p>Living in a world of quality goods and services starts with each one of us
<a href="http://www.43folders.com/2010/02/05/first-care">caring more</a> about what we do
with our lives, what we spend our money on, and most importantly, where and
how we spend our time. No matter what you do, if it is writing software or
changing oil, I want to encourage you to do your absolute <em>best</em>. Because no
matter what you are doing, you make an impact on the world around you, you
matter because you are here, and when you start to believe that what you do
makes a difference, you start to care a little more, and when you care about
your work, you make the world around you a little better every day.</p>
<p>So, today, as you go to work, or prepare for the next day, or think about what
might come next…</p>
<p>be great.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2011-01-16-from_zero_to_the_app_store.html'>From Zero to the App Store</a></h2>
<p>This past Thursday I was privileged to speak at our local
<a href="http://cocoaheads.org/us/DesMoinesIowa/index.html">CocoaHeads</a> about my
history, and how I was able to bring my app to market. Since someone on
Twitter asked for <a href="http://public.iwork.com/document/?d=CocoaHeads_Presentation.key&amp;a=p62622474">my slides</a>, which don't amount to much, I thought writing up
my experiences would be a little more useful.</p>
<p>I didn't grow up with computers. My first experiences programming were not
when I was six on my Dad's Apple II. We were poor, we lived on an Indian
reservation in Montana, and for a good part of my life we lived in a mobile
home. My first experience with a computer was in high school, after a semester
of learning to type on an IBM Selectric, we moved on to one semester of
computers, which was basically typing out documents in WordPerfect. That was
it… for years. I didn't start learning computers in depth until I had been in
the Navy for a few years, and needed to learn them to make rank as a Radioman.
It was then that I found I had a knack for technology, and started pursuing
it. My first computer was a PC, a mistake I made exactly once. I had the
machine for a few months before Linux was loaded on it for the first time. In
2000 I was introduced to Unix, and started working with OpenBSD, Linux, HP-UX,
and Solaris. I enjoy Unix, I find that the system has a spartan elegance to
it, especially the BSD flavors. Around this same time I heard that Apple was
basing their new operating system, OS X, off of Unix, and I was anxious to try
it out. In 2003, we moved back to the states, and I bought my first Mac, an
iBook G4.</p>
<p>The iBook served me well, and I fell in love with the Mac and with the Mac
community. I became a regular reader of Daring Fireball, and was inspired by a
post named "<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/10/the_life">The Life</a>". However,
I had one college semester of programming experience in C, an experience that
left a bad taste in my mouth, so I figured that "The Life" was out of my
reach, put it behind me and moved on. Eventually I got out of the Navy and
found work as a Unix sysadmin, using the skills that I learned while on active
duty. The reality of work in a cubicle is much different than I imagined it
would be. In the Navy there is always something different right around the
corner. You will spend a max of 3-4 years at a single command, and during
those years you will most likely have several different jobs. Things are much
different as a civilian, and while I have a good job, the prospects of keeping
this same job for the next ten or more years scares me more than a little. So,
the question that came to mind was "is this what I want to do for the next 30
years?", and Gruber's article on The Life came back to mind.</p>
<p>So, I decided to learn Objective-C.</p>
<p>This decision was not taken lightly. I considered the possibility that it was
beyond me, that I was not smart enough, or that I did not have the necessary
math and programming and educational background to become a developer. Could I
be dedicated enough to learn something so far out of my area? Was I smart
enough to learn this? That last question gnawed at me, and I finally decided
that there was no way I was going to know unless I tried, and gave it
everything I had. So, I did some googling and found that for first timers
wanting to learn Cocoa, most experienced developers pointed to what I now
simply refer to as "The Book", <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Programming-Mac-OS-3rd/dp/0321503619">Cocoa Programming for Mac OS
X</a>.</p>
<p>For the next several months, I would wake up at 5AM and go through The Book,
page by page, chapter by chapter, every challenge, no cheating. If I got stuck
on something, I'd search the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/navigation/">Apple developer
documentation</a> (which is
excellent), or search through the
<a href="http://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/cocoa-dev">CocoDev</a> mailing list
archives. I was investing in my future, so it was important to understand
everything in The Book. Eventually, I finished The Book, and started working
on my own little Mac app, a GUI version of a little shell script that I wrote
called "go".</p>
<p>The first few versions of Go were tough. I had a hard time getting my head
wrapped around the "Modal, View, Controller" framework that Cocoa and the Mac
developer tools are built around. I could not for the life of me figure out
how to get an image to display in an NSTableView. That was by far the single
most difficult hurdle I had to overcome. Changing my mindset from "Ok, place
button here, and place image here", which didn't work, to "OK, place button
here, and display data from my data source in this table". I struggled for
weeks, months even with this simple concept. Trying to work against the MVC is
a sure way misery and failure. It was around this time that I found the local
CocoaHeads group. I went to a meeting, and the speaker (a great guy), was
talking about drawing pixels and getting your views to look <em>just</em> right. It
was interesting, to be sure, but over my head at the time. I left that meeting
disheartened, feeling that maybe it was simply too much for me, and I was just
not smart enough.</p>
<p>I gave up, and for several months did not touch Xcode or Cocoa.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what brought me back, but I have a feeling it was stubbornness.
The idea that there was a learned skill that I could not learn was too much
for me. I started getting the feeling that I was <em>almost there</em>, that my
understanding of Cocoa was incomplete, but I was just one more article read,
one more blog post scanned, from finding the missing piece. So, I started
reading again, I started building again, and piece by piece I started to
understand Cocoa. I found that the best way for me to display an image was to
use a value transformer. Store the data as a string, transform that string to
an image, and the NSTableView would happily display that image for me. I
started asking questions on Twitter and the mailing lists, and was recognized
by <a href="http://www.nukethemfromorbit.com/">Jim Turner</a>, who ran CocoaHeads in Des
Moines.</p>
<p>Jim is not the type of guy to give you an answer, but he is the type of guy to
point you in the right direction. Jim and I exchanged emails a few times, and
he pointed out where I was going about things wrong, or making things harder
than they needed to be. Eventually, I built real, working versions of Go,
which Jim was kind enough to beta test. Some of his critiques of Go were
scathing, but absolutely necessary. Each email Jim would send me with a list
of things that were wrong with Go, I'd drop into a to-do list and check off
each item as it was fixed.</p>
<p>Some features that I worked on for months I killed. Some features that I spent
months working on and hundreds of lines of code I found could be replaced with
only a few lines of more functional code. The original version of Go used
AppleScript and the Cocoa ScriptingBridge framework to launch the Terminal. I
would build a shell script in Cocoa, then send that to the Terminal as a "Do
Shell Script" AppleScript. This entire structure was replaced when I learned
about the functionality of NSWorkspace and NSURL. Now, all bookmarks are URLs,
and opened by NSWorkspace. Much simpler, and more functional. This discovery
allowed me to take Go in a new direction, instead of being a launcher for SSH
connections, Go could be a universal bookmarker, storing and launching
bookmarks for anything that could be addressed by URL, which turns out to be
just about everything. I finalized the functionality of Go, and spent another
month or so building in a copy protection scheme and a 30 day trial, and…
launched.</p>
<p>Farmdog Software was launched to the amazement of no one. I had the store open
for three months and sold a grand total of seven copies of Go. I was
languishing in obscurity. No one knew what Go was, who I was, or had heard of
Farmdog Software. Then Apple announced the Mac App Store, and I knew that was
my opportunity.</p>
<p>I started an entire redesign of Go, and renamed the application Go2. I
redoubled my efforts. Now I was not only programming in the morning before
work, but also at lunch, and at night after the kids were in bed. I built a
custom NSCell class, and spent a long time building the Status Bar search menu
that Go2 has now. Jim came to the rescue once again with a way to use the down
arrow to navigate out of the search field, which was the final piece of the
Go2 puzzle.</p>
<p>I submitted Go2 to the App Store, and in the last week of December it was
rejected. Turns out there was an odd bug that only showed itself at launch
time, and only on the first time the app was launched. I fixed that bug,
resubmitted, and Go2 was in the store on day 1.</p>
<p>Go2 and Farmdog still have a long, long ways to go, but they are on their way,
and that's the important thing. If anyone can take anything away from all this
I hope that it is to never give up. Never. Nothing worth doing is ever easy.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2010-12-15-The-Proper-Place-of-Technology-In-Our-Lives.html'>The Proper Place of Technology In Our Lives</a></h2>
<p>It's now the middle of December, which signals the end of my first semester of
grad school. I took two classes, both focused on HCI: cognitive psychology and
social implications. The paper I just finished writing for the social
implications course was about answering the question of whether all software
should be free, and required a lot of research into open source, the Free
Software Foundation, and a lot of deep thinking about what I felt was right.</p>
<p>The definitions of freedom offered by the Free Software Foundation act on the
assumption that computers are central to a persons well being, and that the
user of a computer should have full and complete access to the source code of
the computer based on a natural right of well being. However, it is my
position that computers, or any other form of technology, only serve to
increase personal freedom of the user <strong>in proportion to the increase in
overall quality of life of the user of the technology</strong>.</p>
<p>Richard Stallman, in his essay entitled “<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-free.html">Why Software Should Not Have
Owners</a>” claims that authors of
software can claim no natural right to their work, citing the difference
between physical products and software, and rejecting the concept of a
tradition of copyright. Stallman uses an example of cooking a plate of
spaghetti to explain the difference between software and physical products:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I cook spaghetti, I do object if someone else eats it, because then I
cannot eat it. His action hurts me exactly as much as it benefits him; only
one of us can eat the spaghetti, so the question is, which one? The smallest
distinction between us is enough to tip the ethical balance. But whether you
run or change a program I wrote affects you directly and me only indirectly.
Whether you give a copy to your friend affects you and your friend much more
than it affects me. I shouldn't have the power to tell you not to do these
things. No one should.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, what Stallman does not address what gives the second person who
receives the software the right to benefit from the authors work without
giving something in return.</p>
<p>Before the industrial revolution, most people learned a skill and worked for
themselves in small communities. A single village would have all of the skill
sets necessary to sustain itself, and each member of the community would
apprentice into a particular skill set to contribute and earn a living. The
industrial revolution pushed skilled workers into factories and assembly
lines, work that was both distasteful and disdainful to an artisan in the
craft. However, corporations were able to reduce cost and increase profits,
and the platform has persisted into current work environments.</p>
<p>In the information age, the assembly line mindset has created oceans of
cubicles filled with programmers who use their skills in small parts of large
software projects, sometimes to great success, but far too often to failure.
The Internet and popularity of lower priced computers has created a market for
high quality third party software, the kind that is created by someone with a
<a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/">passion for what they are doing</a>. This passion
comes from learning a craft, and using that skill to earn a living, just like
the workers from before the industrial revolution. Instead of living
physically in small villages, these new age artisans live online and create
communities built around social networking.</p>
<p>In many ways, this is a return to a more natural way of life, and a simple
form of commerce. One person can create an application and sell it, and
another person can buy it from him. The person selling the software benefits
from being able to purchase shelter, food, and clothing for his family, and
the person who buys the software benefits from the use of the software. It is
a very simple transaction, and a model that is not adequately explained in the
GNU essays. If all proprietary software is wrong, then an independent
developer who sells software as his only job is also wrong. GNU supporters
could argue that there is nothing stopping the programmer from selling his
software, but he should give away the source code under a license that permits
redistribution along with the software once it is sold. At this point, selling
the original program no longer becomes a viable business model. A programmer
can not continue to sell his software when the user can, and is encouraged to,
download his software from somewhere else for free.</p>
<p>While it may be the ethically right thing to do to purchase the software if
you intend to use it, ethics alone are often insignificant motivation to
encourage people to spend their money. If the choice of supporting the
development of the software or not is entirely up to the user of the software,
then purchasing the software becomes a choice that the user can make on a
whim, with no real implications on the conscience of the user with either
decision. GNU and the GPL place this decision squarely on the user, and
encourage the users to not feel in any way obligated to pay.</p>
<p>The ethics of open source come into question when the requirement of adhering
to the free software philosophies result in an independent developer not being
able to support a moderate, middle-class lifestyle by developing a relatively
popular application. Kant’s first formulation asks what would happen if all
developers gave away the source of their code for free. In this imaginary
world where all developers did this, the quality of software would go down to
the lowest common denominator of acceptability. Each developers motivation
would be to develop for himself, and since he would need to find a source of
income elsewhere, only in the free time allotted to him. This would result in
a wide variety of software availability, with very little integration or
testing, mirroring the current state of GNU/Linux based desktop operating
systems. Current software companies would move to a business model arranged
around providing support to customers of their software. Competition, and
therefore innovation, based on pure software features would decrease, since
the source code of any feature another group could develop would be easily
copied and integrated into competitors products.</p>
<p>A second implication of business providing support as their primary source of
income is that the support becomes the product, not the software itself.
Businesses then have a vested interest in creating software that requires
support, resulting in intentionally complicated user interfaces.</p>
<p>From a utilitarian point of view, the outcome of proprietary software has
clearly been to produce more pleasure for more people than open source has up
to this point. Open source software is often more complicated, difficult to
learn and maintain, and harder for the average computer user to use. Apple
produces proprietary software and hardware, and states their mission to “make
the best stuff”. Using their position as a leading software company, and
leveraging their control over their computing environment, including iPads,
iPods, iPhones, and Mac computers, Apple has been able to successfully
negotiate deals with entertainment companies. The deals Apple has made allow
the consumer to download music, television shows, and movies off of the
Internet and watch them on any Apple branded device, and output the media to
their televisions or home stereo systems. Because of the limits of Digital
Rights Management, open source or free systems have not been able to provide
this level of entertainment.</p>
<p>Free software enables the user to learn the intricacies of how the software
works, and modify the software to suit his needs. Free software also provides
a legal and ethical alternative to expensive proprietary software in
developing nations or areas where the cost of obtaining a license for legal
use of the software is prohibitive. Public institutions, like schools and
government offices, where the focus of the organization is the public good,
have the option to use software that is in the public domain and is not
controlled by any one company.</p>
<p>However, proprietary software is also beneficial to the public, as well as
respectful of the original authors rights regarding their creative work.
Software is the result of a person’s labor; it does not matter how easy it is
to copy that work, the author still retains a natural right of ownership,
according to John Locke’s <em>The Second Treatise of Government</em>. Proprietary
software enables products like the iPad, which is being used to enable elderly
people, nearly blind with cataracts, to <a href="http://www.portlandtribune.com/features/story.php?story_id=128882605915653000">create creative works</a> of their own.
The iPad is also being used by caretakers of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/nyregion/31owen.html?_r=1">severely disabled
children</a> to
enable them to communicate and express themselves. It is possible that the
iPad would have been created if the software used to power it had been free,
but that is unknown. What is known is that the net result of the device is to
better peoples lives, which is the true purpose of technology. Any technology
is merely an enabler to get more satisfaction and enjoyment out of life. What
the free software movement does is exaggerate the importance of a specific
type of freedom, without addressing the proper place of technology in our
lives.</p>
<p>However, the existence of free and open source software alongside proprietary
software creates a mutually beneficial loop, wherein consumers and developers
are able to reap the rewards of constant innovation and competition. There is
a place for both proprietary and free software, and it is the authors natural
right to their creative work that gives them the freedom to choose how and why
their software will be distributed.</p>

<p>A long, long time ago, what seems like a different life now, I was a Sailor.
Towards the end of my teenage years, I came to a point where I knew I had to
do something with my life, and at the time, that something was not college. My
adoptive father was in the Navy, so I decided to follow in his footsteps and
joined the Navy myself in October of 1995. From June of 1996 to July of 1999 I
was assigned to the USS Platte, an oiler. During this time I made the best
friends of my life, met my wife, and travelled across Europe and even into the
Middle East.</p>
<p>It was a different world back then, back before 9/11. It was a brief time of
peace, a period of national calm that came after the cold war was over, and
before the war on terror began. I went on two six-month deployments to the
Mediterranean, Med cruises we called them. We would travel from port to port,
spending anywhere from a couple of days to three weeks in port, followed by a
week or two underway.</p>
<p>In port, my friends and I would make a point of going out and seeing the
sights during the day, before taking in the local beverages at night. I loved
the architecture, I loved the age of some of the buildings and castles that we
found. Back here in the States, if a home gets to be one hundred years old,
its an amazing thing, but over there structures built by man could last for
hundreds and hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when we were out to sea, the water would be so calm it looked like
glass. Other times the waves splashed over the weather decks and would
threaten to wash an unwary sailor overboard. During those times I'd have to
take medicine from the ship's doctor to try to ward off the seasickness that
would invariably come. I never got over it, in three years I never got my "sea
legs" like most of the guys did. But mostly it wasn't a problem, most of the
time we avoided the rough weather and stayed in the calmer seas to do our
refueling of other ships. Most times the waves were small enough that I could
stand on the edge of the ship and watch flying fish dart between the crests of
the waves. And sometimes, I would close my eyes and smell the salt in the air.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2010-06-16-quality.html'>Quality</a></h2>
<p>We've been having a months long discussion at work around which Linux OS to
use. It's all come to a head recently, and it looks like the winner is going
to be Red Hat. The decision leaves a slightly sour taste in my mouth, but over
the course of the past year I've gotten used to having it around. While trying
to understand why I've got such a dislike for this particular flavor of Linux,
I thought it might help to take another look at <a href="http://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>.</p>
<p>OpenBSD and I go back a long ways. It was the first Unix operating system that
I really got to know well. I had worked with HP-UX a little, and Solaris a
little more, and a few flavors of Linux, mostly Mandrake and SuSE, but OpenBSD
was different. OpenBSD doesn't give you any room to not be an expert. You need
to know what it is doing, and why it is doing it. The demanding nature of
OpenBSD begins with the installation, which is actually a shell script with a
few prompts thrown in. Back then, you couldn't get the OS in an iso download
like Linux, you either needed to dd an image to a floppy disk and install off
the network, or create your own iso and boot from that. Once you booted the
install disk, you used fdisk to partition your hard drive. Next, the script
would install it's boot image, and after formatting the partitions, simply
unzip the OS into the root partition.</p>
<p>The entire process of installing OpenBSD takes about six minutes. When
finished, the server is ready to be a web server or a firewall, but not much
else. Everything else is build from the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/ports.html#Use">ports
tree</a>.</p>
<p>If you accidentally muck up some file that OpenBSD needs, you could just unzip
the tarball that holds that file from the root partition, and you'd be back
where you started again. I've seen OpenBSD servers run for years without a
problem. They are the kind of server you setup once, and then forget about.
OpenBSD is simple and powerful, and simply feels like quality engineering.</p>
<p>Looking at OpenBSD I discovered the root of my annoyance with Red Hat. Its not
just that Red Hat has continued to add more and more junk to their operating
system for no need. Its not just that they have gone out of their way to
charge their customers more for a more confusing setup. Its that they feel
just like every other modern product on the market today. Full of features,
and lacking in quality.</p>
<p>Its not just a problem with geeky computer operating systems. Its not just a
problem with computers. Its a problem with everything that is on the market
today. Air conditioners, refrigerators, hardwood floors, cars, coffee makers,
the list goes on and on. At some point in our recent past, consumerism took a
turn for the worse. Companies decided that they could make more money if they
made a worse product, and we went along for the ride. So instead of a washing
machine lasting for fifty years, it might go for six before some part in it
goes out, and fixing that part is more expensive than buying an entirely new
machine.</p>
<p>In the 40's and 50's, American companies made some great products. I went to
pick up a mixing bowl for my brother in law the other day that he got off of
Craigslist. It was a classic, built in '48 or so. The seller wanted to show me
that it still worked fine, so she plugged it in and gave me a demonstration.
Sure enough, it fired up and worked perfectly. That little device is at least
sixty years old. What are the odds of any of our small appliances or
electronic devices lasting even half that long today?</p>
<p>My wife's grandmother has a Maytag washer that she's had since she can't
remember when. It has a <strong>hand crank</strong> on the top of it, and she still uses it
to wash clothes today.</p>
<p>There is simply not enough great stuff in the world anymore. Companies produce
crap that's just good enough to get by, offer it up as being worth it because
they'll warranty it for three years. Then it breaks on the fourth year and you
buy another one.</p>
<p>I don't have room in my life for crap.</p>
<p>Things are only expensive if they don't last. Quality lasts. A few companies
get it. <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/design.html">Apple gets it</a>. They don't
build crap. They could start pushing out $300 netbooks and flood the market
with substandard junk that's slow and throwaway breakable, but they don't.
They build quality machines, and improve on them year over year. They build
quality software, and improve on it slowly over time. <a href="http://www.saddlebackleather.com/33-quality">Saddleback
Leather</a> is another company that
seems to get it. The specialize in quality leather goods that are built to
last. Not the "quality leather" that you can get from a TV infomercial, but
real tough leather that only starts getting broken in after the first few
years of daily use. They have the only warranty I'm interested in. 100 years.</p>
<p>Quality. Volkswagen didn't change the basic design of the bug for over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VW_Bug">two
decades</a>. They made small improvements
over time. OpenBSD looks almost the same today as it did when I first fired it
up seven years ago. Its not that they haven't been busy building awesome
software, it's that the initial product is timeless in its simplicity.</p>
<p>Simplicity is hard, admittedly. But what if there were more companies that
took Apple's approach to building consumer products? How about a washing
machine with one button on it that says "wash". Who needs a digital display
and sixty-four buttons on a washing machine? Looking around my kitchen right
now I see I have four clocks. One on the stove, one on the microwave, one on
the radio, and one on the coffee maker. Why? How about a coffee maker with one
button that I press after I've put in the coffee and water? Does everything
need to be digital?</p>
<p>When I look at our server infrastructure I think that it needs to be simpler.
Complexity is the enemy of security, and uptime. Too many companies have taken
the easy way out by not considering how to simplify their products. Linux, all
flavors of Linux, are most guilty of this. The more complex a product is, the
more parts there are that could fail, or at the very least, not work as well
together as they should.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to OpenBSD. I've loved this system for years because of
its simplicity. Which happens to be the same reason I love Macs, and the same
reason I love things made out of leather and oak and metal and glass.
Simplicity and quality.</p>
<p>I don't have room in my life for anything else.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2009-04-09-nkotb.html'>NKOTB</a></h2>
<p>When I was younger, 20 years ago or so I suppose, the New Kids On The Block
(NKOTB) were synonymous with cheesy pop music that was taking over our
airwaves. They weren't just a pop boy band, they were The pop boy band. I
remember the thing was that if you were a guy and you were a NKOTB fan, it
instantly meant you were gay. Which, for an adolescent boy just before his
teens, that meant there was absolutely no way that this band's music would
ever willingly land on his ears. Rumors circulated regularly about the NKOTB
being caught, red-handed no less, in one disgusting sexual tryst or another.
One in particular that I remember was that one of the members had to have his
stomach pumped because he was sick, and they found that it was full of sperm.
That was the stigma attached to this band.</p>
<p>So, I grew, and I found that I much rather enjoyed classic rock and grunge
more than anything else. As I've grown I've learned to appreciate many
different types of music, everything from classical to the Beastie Boys. My
iPod will shuffle from the Grateful Dead to an old Prodigy mix. However, I've
never been a fan of pop music. Boy bands went away for a while, and for the
most part I forgot all about them.</p>
<p>I was kind of surprised when my wife told me this blast from the past was
coming to Des Moines. When she later told me that she wasn't going because
couldn't find anyone to go with her, I felt bad for her, and told her that I'd
take her. What I found at the concert surprised me.</p>
<p>The NKOTB are five guys from Boston who work really hard to put on a good
show. They are talented singers and dancers, and they know how to keep the
crowd entertained. They really are a great band, and when I look back at what
they had to go through, I think that they were probably unfairly ridiculed. We
were lucky enough to get seats on the (nearly empty) stadium, and were able to
get within six feet of the band as they performed a few of their songs in the
center on a rising platform. Getting that close to a person, being able to
look in their eyes and have them look back at you, it's hard to be critical.
Much harder than listening to something on the radio or seeing something on
MTV. I had an important revelation as I watched my wife go nuts over these
guys.</p>
<p>I can't do what they do.</p>
<p>I can neither sing, nor dance. I'm fairly certain that if I ripped off my
shirt in front of a crowd I'd be politely asked to put it back on again. How
can I be so extremely prejudiced against a group of guys that can do things
that I cannot. I really can't. The only thing that I can say is that I'm not a
fan of their pop-sugary style of music. I can't say that any of them are any
less of a man than I am, and to be honest, in some ways much more for having
the guts to do what they do in the first place. The public eye can be vicious.</p>
<p>So, what did I do that night? I looked a legend of the past in the eye, and
gave them my respect. I don't know if they are going to have a lot of success
with this comeback, but I hope that things work out for them.</p>
<p>I also take it as a sign that I have grown to overcome the adolescent
prejudices of my past. I can appreciate the work and talent that goes into
making the music and the shows, even if I don't care for the style of music
itself. I'm not about to replace my collection of bootlegged Dead music for
pop, but I'm glad that I've grown to the point where I feel that I've come
into my own. My own preferences for my own reasons.</p>
<p>Hey, life's too short for hate. And, just as proof, here I am with the
beautiful woman who brought me, who loved the show so much she started
screaming like she was twelve years old again:</p>
<p>Happy Birthday, babe.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2009-02-01-rota.html'>Rota</a></h2>
<p>It was June of 1996 when I arrived in Rota. The Spanish sun was bright as I
stepped off the creaky military aircraft, and I realized that this day would
hold a lot of firsts for me. Today, I was going to meet my ship.</p>
<p>This was the day for which I had been preparing for the last year; U.S. Navy
boot camp in Chicago, followed by engineering common core, (a school designed
to teach us young recruits about the basics of engineering, like, how to turn
a valve), then a class A school in San Diego where the curriculum taught how
to create machinery parts out of metal stock using a lathe and mill, and where
I learned how to stick a twenty in my sock in Tijuana to pay off the crooked
cops. That whirlwind of confused order was designed to prepare me for this
experience, this day, when I begin to earn the title that the United States
government has given me. Today when I set foot on the ship, I will earn the
name Sailor.</p>
<p>After twelve hours of being cramped up in the suffocating small cabin of the
plane, suffering through the tiny, dry in-flight meals, and two movies that I
could neither see clearly through the array of heads in my line of sight, or
hear through the headphones that did not fit properly on my head, I was
relieved to be out in the fresh air again. But my reprise was short lived, as
the airport staff soon herded us into the airport to collect our baggage. Only
one bag for me, the Navy seabag, packed tight with everything that I owned in
the world, except what was boxed up at my parents house in Montana. I reached
down and grabbed my seabag, and hefted it up to my shoulders. As I turned
around, a stocky Hispanic man with thick glasses and tight black hair wearing
Navy dungarees asked me, “You fireman Buys?” he asked. “Yes”, I replied,
“Fireman Recruit Buys.” A broad grin stretched out across his face as he
laughed and said, “Ok, Fireman Recruit Buys, I’m Petty Officer Garcia. Welcome
aboard, and follow me.”</p>
<p>Why was he welcoming me aboard, I wondered, I’m not on the ship yet. I brushed
my trivial concerns behind me and followed him to his plain white government
issue van. We had only a short drive until we stopped in a gravel parking lot
in front of a long concrete pier. I hauled out my seabag and followed Petty
Officer Garcia up the pier. It smelled of salt water and fuel, the breeze
light on my skin. It was then that I got my first good look at the ship I
would be calling home for the next few years. Haze gray paint covered the hull
of the oiler named USS Platte. The ship was smaller, and less impressive than
I thought it would be. Still, it was a good sized ship, approximately two
football fields long. The first two thirds of the ship were dominated by seven
kingposts, metal towers bearing large black hoses. The last third was split;
half was the house, at the top of which was the bridge. At the aft end of the
ship was a small flight deck, large enough for one helicopter.</p>
<p>As Petty Officer Garcia led me up the metal brow, I pulled out my military ID.
At the top of the brow I reached the quarter deck. Before stepping foot on the
metal deck, I faced the American Flag, stood at attention for a moment to pay
respect. Then I turned to the officer of the deck, stood at attention and
presented my ID. “Permission to come aboard.” I requested. “Very well.” Came
the reply. I then set foot on the deck of the ship, a sailor at last. Yes, it
was very well indeed.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2009-01-31-the-gi-hole.html'>The GI Hole</a></h2>
<p>In December 1995 I was halfway through boot camp, a time called service week.
Service week was when the recruits went to work in the galley. Some served
food, other mopped the floor, and still others handed out miniature boxes of
cereal.</p>
<p>My name was chosen alphabetically for assignment to the GI Hole. There were
six of us; our job was to wash the big pots and pans that the food was cooked
in and to get rid of leftovers. Approaching the hole from the glistening clean
galley, the walls would grow continually darker, the air thicker and warmer,
and the odor more pungent. The hole itself was a very large room; with pots
and pans stacked six feet high along three of the four walls.</p>
<p>We would work at a feverish pitch, trying desperately to finish at a decent
hour. I was nearly deafened by the sound of the metal pans flying down the
metal trough. One person would scrub a little, and then pass, scrub then pass.
In the morning, the butcher would come with his gigantic cauldron the size of
a wheelbarrow and dump the blood on the floor so it would run down the drain
in the middle of the floor.</p>
<p>The problem was, the blood didn't drain.</p>
<p>The screen covering the drain would clog up, and the water we used to spray
the pans with would begin to collect on the ground. By noon, we were standing
in two inches of warm water, rotten food, and blood. Over the course of the
day, scraps of food build up, and we would dump them in a large metal bin
three feet long and a foot deep. When the bin was full of leftover scraps of
food, it was time to feed Igor.</p>
<p>Igor was the industrial strength garbage disposal in the center of our shallow
gutter that we used to wash the pans in. We would scoop the food out with our
hands, spread it out on the counter and look for peas. Igor didn't like peas
because they would cause him to choke. Then we would push the food into Igor's
mouth. Igor would churn and spit, and swallow, and tiny bits of food would
spray out of his mouth.</p>
<p>The food would get everywhere, in my hair, in my eyebrows, in my nose, and in
my mouth. Tiny bits of bloody rotting food were getting everywhere, and I
couldn't get it off! Some of my co-workers developed rashes in their arms from
the big black rubber gloves that they wore. These gloves were never washed,
and they came up over the elbow. Little bits of Igor's snacks would get inside
the gloves and fester for months.</p>
<p>Sometimes I ask if anyone remembers the GI Hole, but it seems very few do.</p>
<p>The hole was shut down soon after I left, for sanitary reasons.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2008-12-24-mobileme-is-not-a-blogging-platform.html'>MobileMe is not a Blogging Platform</a></h2>
<p>I thought I'd try OSZen on MobileMe yesterday, to see if I could consolidate even more of my online accounts. Unfortunately, the limitations of both iWeb and RapidWeaver became quickly apparent. I pointed 1and1's DNS servers at MobileMe, and uploaded an iWeb site. I liked the theme, but the first thing that struck me as odd was the URL. In iWeb I configured the site's name to be OSZen, and to use the Blog page as the home page, but the URL turned out to be http://oszen.net/OSZen/blog/blog.html which for the home page was just ridiculous.</p>
<p>Next, I changed the name of the site to "writing", and wound up with a home page URL of http://oszen.net/writing/blog/blog.html. Again, ridiculous. I'm assuming that this is Apple's way of allowing more than one iWeb site, but I wish that it had better support for personal domain names.</p>
<p>The other thing that really bothered me about iWeb's blogging engine was how each new blog post was formatted with the default theme's pictures and text. Meaning that for each post I had to delete the picture and change the layout of the page. This equates to worrying far more about how the site looks instead of concentrating on writing.</p>
<p>These two small items were all it took for me to switch the DNS setting for OSZen back to 1and1, and back to the comforting ease of Wordpress. The great thing about Wordpress is that it's meant for writing and self publishing, and it does it very well. The more recent ability to update itself and it's plugins only adds to the ease of maintaining your own Wordpress installation. Also, I've got MarsEdit, which rocks, and means that I almost never have to actually get into the admin interface of Wordpress. I do all my writing for OSZen from an application that was designed for writing.</p>
<p>I thought it might be fun, since I'm consolidating all of my online accounts and pruning them down, but the truth of the matter is, web hosting at MobileMe is for sharing your family photos with Grandma back home, it's not a serious blogging platform.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2008-09-10-on-graduation-day.html'>On Graduation Day</a></h2>
<p>In May of 1995 I <em>should</em> have graduated from high school in the rocky mountains of Montana. Then, in the following fall, say around August or September, I <em>should</em> have started my pursuit of a college degree. Finally, in May of 2000, I <em>should</em> have graduated from college with a bachelors degree in who knows what.</p>
<p>As fate or God would have it though, that's not the path I took. One night too many spent on the fringe, one too many parties, and one too many disappointments for my parents, and I dropped out of high school in December of 1994. Even then, I thought that I might be making a mistake, so I went ahead and took the GED test, which I passed with flying colors. For nearly a year, I travelled around Washington state. Sleeping in tents, staying with a friend in his uncle's garage, hanging out at a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Gathering">Rainbow Festival</a>… but in the back of my mind, I knew something was wrong. Something inside of me wouldn't let go of the fact that what I was doing was <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>So, one day, after way too much for way too long, I went home, and from there, I left everything I knew behind me and joined the Navy. Looking back on it now, joining the Navy in October of '95 was probably the best decision I ever made. The Navy forced me to sober up, and gave me a structured, goal oriented lifestyle that appealed to me. The Navy gave me discipline when I had no self control. The Navy taught me to believe in myself after many years of being an outcast. The Navy taught me the value of hard work. I began to make incremental steps towards knowing who I really was. Work hard, and make rank.  Study hard, and pass the test. The work that I was forced to do turned into its own reward. I am today, a better man because of the time I spent in the Navy.</p>
<p>However, even with the success I had in the military, I regretted never walking across that stage and receiving my high school diploma. For anyone in the position to care, let me tell you right now, a GED is <em>NOT</em> an equivalent to a degree. A GED labels you for life as a quitter, and someone who couldn't make it at a very basic level. For this, I was ashamed. So, in January of 2000, after transferring to shore duty overseas, I started working on my college degree.</p>
<p>It was fun at first, I took Speech and English, and a few IT courses. A little at a time, when I had the time, one or two courses a semester, sometimes face to face, mostly distance ed, I worked on my degree. Years passed, I transferred back to the States, and I kept taking courses. Some were really difficult (like Project Management… uggg), some were morally challenging (Myth and Culture), and some were genuinely interesting (Algebra, Writing, and Programming). I liked college, not only because the courses I took and the professors I had were interesting, but because the I was constantly challenged. I had something in college that I didn't have in high school, the drive to succeed… to be the best.</p>
<p>Part of that is growing up. Part of it is the discipline I learned in the military. Part of it is that I was just an angry kid who needed some direction. What ever the reason, the result is that I did finally grow up and realize how important education was. The mistakes I made in high school have taken me thirteen years to correct. But, two days ago, on September 8th, 2008, I was awarded my Bachelors Degree in Information Systems Management from the University of Maryland University College. It took eight and a half years.  That's eight and a half years of lost weekends because I was holed up in the bedroom doing homework. That's eight and a half years of long nights of studying at night after the kids were in bed. That's eight and a half years of justifying taking classes, making financial arrangements, taking time away from my wife and our growing family, writing papers, solving formulas, graphs, charts, proctored tests… and stress.</p>
<p>I wasted three years of high school, and it took me eight and a half years to earn my respect back.</p>
<p>Was it worth it? Depends on the question. Was what I did as a kid worth the work that it took to repair the damage? I'd have to say that's a qualified… almost. I can't explain what I did as a teenager, but I can say that I've been places and seen things that most people have not. If your question was "Is the degree worth the work and the time that you put into it?" I have one answer for you.</p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>My degree may never "pay-off" in terms of a big promotion or more opportunities (although it probably will in the long run). I didn't really need the degree with my experience and expertise in IT. The job that I have now required a bachelors or "equivalent experience". When I took the job I did not have the degree, but I had the experience, so one could argue that I don't need the degree at all. For the most part, they'd probably be right.</p>
<p>The degree is worth the effort because I'm a high school drop out. It's worth it because the look of disappointment in my Mom's eyes was more than I could bear. It's worth it because I want my kids to be able to look up to me. The degree is worth it because it was a goal that I had for eight and a half years, and I finally achieved it. Yes, yes, yes, yes yes… the degree is worth every minute of time I put into it, and every penny that it cost.</p>
<p>Mountain climbers, as far as I'm aware, are not paid to climb a mountain, but ask one who has made it to the top if it was worth it.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2008-05-14-the-master-craftsman.html'>The Master Craftsman</a></h2>
<p>The Master Craftsman works methodically, not slowly, not hurriedly. He has mastered the basics, and knows the essence of his craft. He has moved to a point where he can define his own methods, and doesn't need to explain them to anyone, unless someone is wise enough to ask. The Master Craftsman enjoys the hardest, most complicated problems, and enjoys unravelling them piece by piece. He enjoys the challenge to his skill, and proves his worth again and again as he overcomes each obstacle.</p>
<p>The Master Craftsman has an intimate relationship with his tools. He knows not only what they do, but much more importantly, how they do it. His choice of tools for a certain task is based on years of experience, research, and hands on use. He can debate intelligently on the merits and problems with his tools, as compared with other tools that he has tried and discarded over time. His choice of tools explains something about him.</p>
<p>The Master Craftsman enjoys his work, and is comfortable with his place in the world. He is an expert, and he knows it.</p>
<p>I've had an abstract idea for this post for a couple of months now. The Master Craftsman is the embodiment of my professional goals. I'm not one to speak of gurus or wizards, since I come from very down to Earth country in Montana, but a craftsman, or a woodworker is an image that I can grab on to. I'm not a Master yet, but I'm working towards it. My tools are not jigsaws and planers, but vi and zsh, but the basic principles still apply. I think the idea of a craftsman is less about impressing others and more about perfecting his skill.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2008-04-22-starting-over-and-over-and-over.html'>Starting Over</a></h2>
<p>My wife wanted me to read something that she was writing the other day, so I sat down at her laptop on our table and read through it. While I was there, I happened to glance at her email, an old hotmail account, and noticed that she has emails going all the way back to ‘01. A quick glance at my gmail tells me that there is no way I can tell how far back my email goes, but I'm pretty sure that I've lost everything prior to ‘05 or so. I've been accused of having email ADD in the past, and I'm fairly certain there is a bit of truth to it. It seems to hold true for a lot of the technology in my life, I'm just never satisfied with it, and wind up tweaking, fiddling, and otherwise screwing around with my tools until they are either just right or completely screwed up and I throw the entire thing in the trash and start over.</p>
<p>This certainly holds true for my email, I have been through @aol.com, @hotmail.com, @yahoo.com, @mac.com, @inbox.com, @live.com, and finally, @gmail.com. It also holds true for my web sites. I've started 10 or 15 web sites throughout the years, starting with a geocities site back in... what, '99 or so? If I'd have stayed on top of it, I'd have managed to compile a decent amount of writing in one place for 9 years. But, I have some form of technology ADD, and can not seem to be happy with any single system. When I discovered Linux, my curiosity really got the best of me. I must have downloaded and tested 100-125 distros. I installed so many that I started recording them on my old (now defunct) blog, jonstechblog.com, which evolved into the also now defunct, osvids.com. This went on until I "switched" to Mac, and I've been fairly happy with my operating system since. At least I know that there is nothing else out there that's any better than what I have now.</p>
<p>I've learned a lot about what I want out of my technology over the years, and I've found that when I find a good system, even if its not perfect, its best to stick with it until there is a significant reason to change. My curiosity has unfortunately led to my loosing data. Somewhere along the line I lost a lot of email, and a lot of writing, and there is no way to get that back. So, now, I've come to a point where I'm content in the systems that I have in place. My email works great, my OS works great, and I have an excellent blogging platform on a reliable host. I've started over far, far too many times, and it's time to settle down and shoot down some roots. Its time to stop worrying about the method of creation, and focus on the creative process itself.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2008-02-17-license-restrictions.html'>License Restrictions</a></h2>
<p>Software licensing is one of the biggest expenses of high-end server systems.  The vendors charge you not only to use the software, but they charge you for how <em>efficiently</em> you want to use the software as well.  IBM, for example, charges a different license fee for <a href="http://www.cbronline.com/article_news.asp?guid=3331CC24-A0A7-4180-A7D9-032C72F9DD5F">AIX</a> determined by how many cpus are in the system.  So, to scale in response to load, weather its up or out, you have to pay for additional hardware, and then you have to pay for the ability to <em>use</em> that hardware.  We are not talking small numbers here either, we are talking in the upwards of six figures <sup><a href="#fn1-2008-02-17">1</a></sup>, in addition to the cost of the hardware.  In addition to that, if you are using proprietary applications on top of the OS, you are going to have to pay additional licensing fees for those as well.  <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/was/">WebSphere</a> in particular charges on a per cpu basis.</p>
<p>This is where open source solutions really shine.  Companies are already going to pay for the superior performance of the hardware.  Now with Linux and other open source solutions available to run on the software, and vendors like <a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhel/server/mainframe/">RedHat</a> supporting them, companies have a whole new world of capability available to them.  In a rather strange turn of events, IBM is even <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/linux/power/">supporting</a> Linux on it’s power architecture.  The ability to break the chains of restrictive and unnecessary software licensing is well worth the (supposed) trade off in features.  Being able to leave the software licensing and keep the hardware is worth its weight in gold.  You still need to pay for the software, in a more roundabout way, and, in the end, a much more profitable way.</p>
<p>When a company chooses not to pay software licensing and instead to choose open source software for its needs, what it is choosing is to invest in itself instead of investing in another company.  So, instead of paying for support from IBM or HP, a company can pay its employees to train and increase their knowledge, therefore increasing the capability of the company.  When you pay an external source to be the technical knowledge base, you are limited to what they are willing to give you.  When you invest in yourself, you are limited by your imagination.</p>
<p>For many older companies, ones that have been in the tech sector for the past thirty years or so, the idea of being self-supported is incredibly frightening.  They have been used to simply purchasing the software and hardware from a vendor and going back to the vendor when something doesn’t work.  For these companies, migrating to a self-supported open source infrastructure would take more than training, it would take a change in corporate culture.  This will come easier as the newer companies that are proving the capability of open source become successful.  If the culture is unable to change, there is a very good chance that the old companies will be left behind by more agile systems that can respond to the ever increasing rate of change in IT.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2008-02-16-oranges-and-oranges.html'>Oranges and Oranges</a></h2>
<p>A couple of months ago Linux Magazine published an <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/4641">article</a> written by Scott Granneman comparing Mac OS X Leopard and Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon.  I’ve been torn between these two systems, and their respective predecessors for years, so the article was of great interest to me.  As a matter of fact, I was wondering how I missed it to begin with.  The article is well written, but can be boiled down to this one paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux has come a long way when it comes to ease of use, and it’s definitely getting better all the time, but overall Leopard is still ahead of Ubuntu (and both are way ahead of Vista). Apple makes mistakes, but overall its system is more logical, simple, consistent, and unified than Ubuntu, which still has too many elements that are overly complex, inconsistent, and fractured.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The comment thread on this story is actually very interesting as well, as is the thread on <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/12/13/2225208&amp;from=rss">slashdot</a>, that is until the Linux zealots started commenting.  One fanatic in particular going by the name of “progon” wrote a very lengthy comment explaining in detail why both Linux and Vista were superior to OS X.  This comment stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple seldom, if ever, listens to its customers and its designers don’t seem to be in sync with their customer base at all.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is great, especially seeing how Apple <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/131902/2008/02/1052applelistens.html">did just that</a> with the release of OS X 10.5.2.  Its a real shame when people resort to bias when discussing the pros and cons of personal computers, but its really unsurprising.  You simply can’t expect to spend a significant amount of time with any tool without developing some type of personal or emotional connection with it.</p>
<p>The conclusion of Scott’s article was that each operating system has its strengths and weaknesses, and that its really up to the user to decide what is most important to them.  I agree with him in part.  The part that I agree with is that <em>it is</em> up to the user to decide what is most important.  The strongest feature that Linux has is its <em>freedom</em>, and with that freedom, it’s configurability.  In a way, Linux is infinitely configurable, limited only by the users imagination and technical knowledge.  If that freedom and configurability is that important, then Linux most certainly is worth a look.  However, to compare the two operating systems solely on the basis of technical points, leaving out any marketing or cost concerns, Linux clearly has no leg to stand on when compared to the big cat.</p>
<p>The more important factor, and one that Linux seems to overlook more often than not, is what the user wants to <em>do</em> with the computer.  Apple sells a total package, a computing utility. Linux was built by hobbyists and hackers, and piecemeal together. These design approaches are readily apparent in the gui, and the lengths that each takes to present a usable interface.  The important point is not whither the user <em>can</em> perform a certain function, it’s if the user <em>needs</em> the function, and if so, how easy is it for the user to do.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk1w">Compiz Fusion</a> is undeniably cool eye candy, and about %90 useless for getting any real work done.</p>
<p>One other comment that I see popping up quite a bit when discussing Linux and Macs is that they target two separate markets, and that neither infringes much upon the others.  This I think is total bull.  There is only one target market for personal computers, the market comprised of everyone thinking about buying one.  Which operating system that computer runs is not nearly as much of a concern to the user as being able to quickly and efficiently accomplish their tasks.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2008-01-12-no-fail-diet-plan.html'>No Fail Diet Plan</a></h2>
<p>Seriously, does anyone really need to know <em>how</em> to loose weight these days?  No matter what super plan you choose, it always comes down to <strong>eat less an exercise more</strong>. There is no secret formula, and there is no magic pill that will help you achieve the body that you want.</p>
<p>Here's another truth that no one wants to hear: your weight is your fault. You cannot blame genetics, how you were taught to eat, your job, your wife, your husband, your kids, your dog, the government, or any other outside influence other than yourself. It is true that some people are more prone to weight gain than others, but that does not mean that you can't do anything about it.  Blaming anything except your own habits is a cop-out. To start the 100% guaranteed program, you have to face reality, and you have to take responsibility for your own actions.</p>
<p>So, here's my super simple, 100% guaranteed, no way you can <em>not</em> lose weight, weight loss plan.</p>
<p>Step one, watch what you eat. That means no McDonalds, Burger King, Hardie's, or Sonic. Eating fast food makes you fat. I like a <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/app_controller.nutrition.index1.html">double-quarter pounder</a> with fries as much as the next guy, but seriously, you never need that many calories in one setting. I'd say that's like a once every six months meal, not once a week (or day). If you have to eat out, go to Subway and order a six-inch <a href="http://world.subway.com/Countries/NutritionFiles/AUS%209.2005.pdf">veggie delight</a> on whole wheat. Seriously, try it, they are really good!</p>
<p>Next, stop right now and go look in your refrigerator and your pantry. OK, how much pre-prepared food did you see? Boxed, one-pan, no cooking skills necessary stuff, you know what I mean. If you are eating ingredients that you cannot pronounce, there is a problem. For example, I cannot think of the last time a recipe called for <a href="http://chemindustry.com/chemicals/467010.html">L-Cystein Hydrochloride</a>. Use raw ingredients as much as possible. Even if the resulting recipe is high in fat and calories, at least you know what's in it. That leads me to my next point.</p>
<p>Fill up half your plate with veggies. Make a salad that only contains vegetables. Lettuce, carrots, cabbage, broccoli, olives, onions, etc... Fill up a quarter of your plate with a slice of bread or something similar. This is your side dish. That doesn't mean that it gets its own plate, its there to take up room on your plate, and therefor in your stomach. Now you should have only a quarter of your plate left to fill, that's for the main course. Also, get a pint glass of ice cold water to go with your meal. Drink the water before drinking anything else.</p>
<p>Speaking of drinking, here's another hard lesson to learn. Alcohol makes you fat. Alcohol add nothing of value to your diet. As in all things, moderation is OK, but drinking a six pack a night is a sure path to failure. Also, drinking a bottle of wine in one sitting is also very bad for your health.  Remember the glass of water at dinner time? Drink that first, and you won't be as tempted to drink so much beer or wine or whatever you like with your meal.</p>
<p>So, that covers eating and drinking, now for the fun part: exercise! If the sun is shining, turn off the TV, shutdown the computer, and go outside. It's actually very difficult <em>not</em> to exercise when you are outside, because there is always something to do. At the very least, take a walk. Do some gardening, shovel snow, make a snowman, go out and <strong>do something</strong>. You can pick up a sport. I'm learning how to swim laps in a pool. It's not as easy as it sounds, but learning something new is enthralling. I get bored weight lifting and running on the treadmill, but you may really enjoy it.</p>
<p>There are literally thousands of sports, and if you keep looking, you are bound to find one that's just challenging enough without being too overbearing. However, you must be brave, because here is the final hard lesson to learn. When you try something new, you are going to look like a fool. This is universal, and unavoidable. No matter what it is, no one is good at something the first time they try it. No matter what your chosen exercise is, until you get <em>good</em> at it, you are going to look silly. Be brave, this will pass. Here's the great thing, the more you do it, the better you get at it, and the less ridiculous you will look doing it. Right now I rather resemble an obese housecat thrown into the pool while I'm learning how to swim. That's OK, it will pass, the more I swim, the better I get at it.</p>
<p>Nothing worth doing is easy.</p>
<p>Focusing on technique, and actually getting better at something, while watching what you eat, naturally leads to the goal: <em>better health</em>. Better health means you can climb those stairs without getting winded, it means you can go ahead and sign up for the corporate softball league, it means you can keep up with your son when he wants to play football with you in the back yard, and you can keep up with your daughter when she wants to play basketball in the driveway. Better health naturally means a smaller waistline, and less extra pounds to carry around.</p>
<p>Eat less, eat <em>better</em>, and exercise. 100% no fail, guaranteed to work, every time. Period. Now, as for me, I'm going out back to try out my new set of cross-country skis, and play in the snow with my kids. I'll be back online, but not until after a good workout.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2008-01-06-911.html'>9/11</a></h2>
<p>I slept. The world changed all around me, and I slept.</p>
<p>My wife woke me up in a shaking, excited voice, "Jon, get up! Terrorists
attacked the World Trade Center!" I remember thinking that she must have been
watching a movie of some sort, and I dozed off again. A few minutes later, I
got up, put on some sweats and a flannel shirt, and went downstairs to see
what she was talking about.Rhonda's eyes were wet and red with shock. She sat
on the edge of our recliner,her knees together, her elbows on her knees, and
her chin in her hands. She was watching television, and again I thought that
she was watching a movie. Attack on America, the headline said in bright red
letters at the bottom of the screen. We were watching CNN.</p>
<p>Suddenly feeling the need not to stand, I took a seat on our couch. The
picture on our screen showed the World Trade Centers moldering, smoking, and
burning.The reporter spoke of chaos, of passenger airplanes crashing into the
Pentagon and into both towers of the World Trade Center. As we watched, the
structural integrity of the first tower failed, and the tower collapsed.
Rhonda began to cry. I looked at the screen in disbelief. For some reason, I
could not get the idea out of my head that we were watching a movie. I had the
sensation that we were being fooled, like the Orson Welles 1938 radio
broadcast of "War of the Worlds." I knew, however, that this was not "War of
the Worlds"; this was more like Pearl Harbor, this was War.</p>
<p>Not long after the first tower fell, the second collapsed in on itself. During
the second tower collapse, America lost many of its bravest men and women; the
firefighters and policemen we now herald as fallen heroes. I walked into the
dining room to use the phone. I called into work to make sure that the watch
was paying attention to the message traffic. Working in military
communications, I knew that they would have a lot of correspondence to deal
with. My overly excitable Chief answered the phone. I asked to talk to someone
on watch, since I was obviously not going to get any answers out of him; he
sounded as if he were going to have a heart attack.</p>
<p>"Well, we're pretty busy, is this really important?' He asked.</p>
<p>"I just wanna make sure that the watch is keeping a close eye" I responded.</p>
<p>"Oh, yea, we're really jumpin' here, everybody's really busy, we got flash
traffic coming all over the place!"</p>
<p>I found out later that he was the only one running around.</p>
<p>"Ok, thanks Chief."</p>
<p>I got off the phone and returned to the living room.My wife was in tears,
horrified and amazed that such a thing could happen. I sat back down on the
couch and began to contemplate my own feelings. At first it seemed that I felt
nothing. I remember wondering if I were so desensitized to violence that I was
incapable of feeling anything. As I watched the firemen, policemen, and
volunteers sift through the rubble, a desire came over me, a desire to help. I
wanted to do something! I wanted to be in New York or Washington D.C. I wanted
to help, to put hand to brick and begin the immediate repair of what the evil
men had destroyed. I wanted to be surrounded by the smoke, ash, and debris. I
wanted to put goggles over my eyes and a handkerchief over my mouth and make
my way though the rubble the fallen towers had left. I wanted to find
survivors. I wanted to hear the cries of victims, to smell the burning of the
buildings to feel the dust collect on my clothes as I worked day and night to
find survivors.</p>
<p>I could do none of those things. I was in my living room, watching television.
We watched the news for the rest of the day, and when night came, I slept.</p>
</article><article><h2><a href='2007-03-25-change-and-blessing.html'>Change and Blessing</a></h2>
<p>On Monday, the 23rd, at 9:17 AM, we were blessed with our fourth child, Jacob. Jacob and his Mom are home now, after a few days stay in the hospital at the University of Iowa. Jacob is strong and healthy, waking every few hours to eat and burp and have his diaper changed.</p>
<p>The day before, Sunday the 22nd, our van broke down. And, being the non-
mechanic that I am, I ecided that it must be the starter. So, I went down to the auto parts store and picked up a new starter, brought it home and tried, and tried, and tried to install it. After several hours of swearing at the van, I resigned to my fate and packed up my tools. I would have to get the van fixed on Monday.</p>
<p>This caused a problem. My Mom is visiting to help us out while everything is so crazy. She was going to take the kids to school in the van while I took the wife to the hospital for her scheduled C section, and then meet us at the hospital later. With the van out of commission, that plan was no good. So, it was decided to keep the kids home with my Mom until lunch. Then, BJ got sick and threw-up all over our bed, soaking through almost all the way to the mattress. So, since we didn't have a spare set of clean sheets or covers that day, we decided that Rhonda would sleep with the kids in their room, and I'd pull out the hide-a-way in the couch and stay with BJ just in case. Needless to say, neither of us got much sleep that night.</p>
<p>Monday morning came, my wife and I let the kids sleep in and we drove to thehospital. It was an incredible morning, and I was so glad to see that Jacobwas healthy and strong. Around noon or so, I left the hospital after I wassure that both mother and child were OK and that they simply needed to rest. Ialso had other kids that needed me, and some other issues to take care of.</p>
<p>My wife was not doing as well as I had hoped. The anesthesia that she wasgiven made her very sick, and with the stitches from the C section she wasjust miserable. I stayed with her and Jacob for the evening and then headedback home.</p>
<p>As if this wasn't enough, I've also come to the end of the semester forcollege. I had three term papers to write, two for one class and one foranother. I finished two of them over the weekend, but the last one I didn'tfinish till yesterday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I dropped off the kids at school and went down to the hospital. Ivisited Jacob and my wife for an hour or so (she was feeling much better),then jumped in my car and headed to Des Moines for an interview. Yes, aninterview. That's why I needed my dry cleaning, I was picking up my suit. Oncein Des Moines I wanted to print out a fresh copy of my resume, so I went allover town looking for a Kinkos. I finally found one, but their system was notworking at the time, and I had run out of time. I jumped in my car and startedchanging into my suit. I tied my tie in my rear view mirror, and really had noidea how I looked when I stepped out of my car in my suit at <a href="http://cds-global.com">Communications Data Services</a>.</p>
<p>The interview went way better than I could have imagined. We talked for almostfour hours and I felt like we really hit it off. I met with the entire teamand we talked Linux and AIX for a while. They must have felt as good about thematch as I did, because by Friday morning I had an offer that I could not turndown. I accepted the offer, and start May 14th.</p>
<p>My wife and Jacob came home on Thursday, and I went back to work for theafternoon. Friday, after I received and accepted the offer from CDS, I gave myboss my two weeks notice. That did not go quite as well as I was hoping itwould, but its for the best.</p>
<p>We are not getting much sleep right now, and probably won't for the next fewweeks. My wife is going to need our prayers, she is going to be alone with allfour kids for a few weeks while I start work in Des Moines and get everythingready for the move. Never a dull moment in our lives!</p>
<p>So, to sum it all up:</p>
<ol>
<li>New Baby!! :-)</li>
<li>New Job!! :-)</li>
<li>Broken Van</li>
<li>Sick Kid</li>
<li>College Papers</li>
</ol>
<p>What a week! I can't wait to see what next week brings. God has really blessed us and answered our prayers.</p>
