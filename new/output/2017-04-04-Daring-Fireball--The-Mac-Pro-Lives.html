		<h1>Daring Fireball - The Mac Pro Lives</h1>
		    <blockquote>
<p>Apple is currently hard at work on a “completely rethought” Mac Pro, with a modular design that can accommodate high-end CPUs and big honking hot-running GPUs, and which should make it easier for Apple to update with new components on a regular basis. They’re also working on Apple-branded pro displays to go with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those of us who make their living on their Mac, this is fantastic news. I might never buy a Mac Pro[^1], but I'll still reap the benefits of Apple's development and focus on Mac hardware and software. This is a message to the community that Apple hasn't lost it's mind; the Mac is still going strong.</p>
<p>What I will plan on buying is a new Apple display. My current Dell 4K display is <em>ok</em>, but after being spoiled by the Thunderbolt Display I had on my desk at the previous gig, this Dell feels like a big step back. No built in iSight camera, no built in speakers, too many wires, and that ugly Dell logo on the front. It's a beautiful screen, and I need that for the number of hours I spend looking at text every day, but it's all the rest of it, that overall Apple experience, that I'm missing.</p>
<p>I'll be interested to hear <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/849235947896098817">what Marco has to say</a> this evening on ATP. He has, at least to my mind, been the biggest skeptic and nay-sayer within the community when it comes to future prospects for the Mac. Of course, that's nothing new. Mac enthusiasts have been hearing that their favorite computer is <em>just</em> about to die for literally decades. Yet here we are.</p>
