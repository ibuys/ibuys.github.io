		<h1>Farmdog Closed</h1>
		    <p><em>Update: July 30, 2013 - Farmdog is not closed, but I am rethinking everything. Paragraphs will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future.</em></p>
<p>Farmdog Co. has closed. There had not been a single sale of Paragraphs for two weeks, and over three weeks since there was more than a single sale in a day. Farmdog was a fun project, but flawed in both concept and execution. </p>
<p>For anyone looking for similar functionality to Paragraphs, I highly recommend <a href="http://bywordapp.com">Byword 2.0</a> with Wordpress or <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com">Jekyll</a>. </p>
