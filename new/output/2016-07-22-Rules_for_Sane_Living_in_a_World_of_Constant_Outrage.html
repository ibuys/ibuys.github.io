		<h1>Rules for Sane Living in a World of Constant Outrage</h1>
		    <p>Turn it all off. </p>
<p>I've deleted the twitter apps from my phone and computer, I don't log into Facebook anymore, and I'm limiting when I read news outside of the tech news to once a week. It just became too much, I started feeling angry all the time, and reading more news wasn't making me feel any better about it. There was nothing I could do about how I felt, there were no actions I could take to assuage the pain. The constant flow of new events across the world to be outraged about is too much for anyone to handle. </p>
<p>So, I've started myself on a strict information diet. Unless the news is related to Apple or the tech industry, or any of my hobbies,[^1] I'm leaving it till Saturday morning after I've gone on a long run. </p>
<p>There is plenty of evidence that binging on news is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/19/violent-media-anxiety_n_6671732.html">detrimental to your health</a>. In the past few months I've noticed my mental state has grown significantly more pessimistic about the state of the world, when in truth my personal circumstances have never been better.[^2]  </p>
<p>That's not to say that the issues in the world right now are not serious, or that I don't care about the many, many problems affecting our society. I do. I care enormously. I simply can't let how much I care dictate how I feel about everything else. I'm not cutting myself off completely, I'm simply making a decision for myself about when and how much of the news I'll allow in. When the time comes for action, I'll take it.[^3] I just don't need to be reminded about what I already know over, and over, and over. </p>
<p>Sometimes the best thing to do for your own mental health is to log off. </p>
<p>[^1]: Reading, writing, gardening, running, and general travel and hiking. 
[^2]: I work from home, in a good job, with a company that I respect and love working for. Raising four kids will always bring times of hardship and doubt, but overall we are ok.<br />
[^3]: By taking action I mean writing a letter to my senator, or participating in a march, or voting for who I feel will make the world a better place. I abhor violence.</p>
