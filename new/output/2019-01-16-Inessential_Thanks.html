		<h1>Inessential Thanks</h1>
		    <p>I believe this will be the last I muck about with the design of the site for the foreseeable future. After being disappointed by the available themes, and further disappointed by my own design ability, I went back to basics. And by basics I mean that I found a few sites that I like the look of and copied large chunks of HTML and CSS to build a custom Jekyll theme. </p>
<p>Readers of Brent Simmons' <a href="http://inessential.com">Inessential</a> site will probably recognize the fonts and general layout. I've added navigation at the top, minimized the layout to bare HTML5 tags, and setup some color here and there. I've also set up a bit of responsiveness for media, and syntax highlighting for code blocks. My hope is that this will be a good baseline for any future work I put into the site, but attribution must be made first. </p>
<p>I enjoy the simplicity of the design, and how clean and readable it is now. I especially like that there is no Javascript in use. Nothing but pure HTML and CSS. No tracking, no stats, nothing dynamic or fancy. It's just you, me, and the text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PS. Brent was kind enough to give his blessing to the new design, for which I'm greatly appreciative.</p>
