		<h1>A Runner</h1>
		    <p>My workout this morning called for five miles. Run two, walk one, run the last two. I think in the Fall or Spring it would have been fairly easy, but today, in the July heat and humidity, every step felt like dragging a pair of anchors. My muscles gave out sooner, my breath ran out faster… it was a hard workout. I finished it though, because what I've learned is that even when it's hard, even when you are having a tough time and not going as fast as you'd like, you always have to finish. </p>
<p>I never imagined myself as a runner. I certainly don't look like one. Before I started this friends of mine would talk about running marathons and half-marathons I'd look at them in wonder and think how <em>I'd</em> never be able to do something like that. Now I've run two 5ks, one 10k, and I'm scheduled to run another 5 and another 10 in the next few weeks. I get up at five almost every morning during the week and run, and normally have another long run on Saturday. I think after a few years of this I'm finally comfortable enough to say I've become a runner. Today, even though I'm not ready to say I'm training for a marathon, the possibility is there, for the first time in my life.  </p>
<p>I'm not sure this would have happened without my iPhone. Every morning I strap it on my arm, launch the <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/running/nikeplus/gps-app">Nike+</a> app, start a podcast in <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> in the background, and start the day. Before I used Nike+ I used the excellent <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/couch-to-5k/id448474423?mt=8">Couch to 5k</a> app, which gently took me through getting off my lazy butt and pounding the pavement. The most important thing I took away from that app was the routine. Once I ran the 5k I didn't want to stop, so I switched to another app and a longer goal and kept going. </p>
<p>Running is my time. It's what I do for myself, it's how I make sure that the day is started right. It's how I can put my busy mind to rest. It's how I can balance staring into a computer screen all day solving puzzles with my concept of who I am and who I should be. Running is hard, running hurts, running is difficult and uncomfortable, running is calming, running is meditation. </p>
<p>I run in the heat and humidity. I run in the rain. I run in the freezing, bitter cold of winter. I run in the dark. I run before daybreak and I watch the sunrise over a pond along my route. I run with my dog. I run alone. I run in new shoes that give me blisters on my heels. I run when it hurts. I run when the weather is crisp and cool, and I've got all the energy in the world, and my legs forget their burden and carry me for miles and I feel like I could run around the world. </p>
<p>I'm a runner.</p>
