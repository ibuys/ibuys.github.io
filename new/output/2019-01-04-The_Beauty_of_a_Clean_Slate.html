		<h1>It's the Price</h1>
		    <p>The recent hubbub about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/apples_terrible_no_good_very_bad_earnings_warning">Apple's earnings guidance</a> has "analysts" and pundits talking a lot about China and the global economic situation. I'm sure there's something to all that, but my take is simpler… the new iPhones are priced too high.</p>
<p>I'm not ready to spend a thousand bucks on a new phone, even though the X-series looks very nice. I've talked to several other people who feel the same way I do, one just this morning, even though we are both still running the 6S. Personally, at this price, I'll keep running my phone till it doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, if Apple came out with a real successor to the iPhone SE, maybe an X-series SE at a similar price point as the previous SE, I'd be very interested in that. But, we'll see how the next year or so plays out. </p>
