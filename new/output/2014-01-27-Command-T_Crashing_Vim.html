		<h1>Command-T Crashing Vim</h1>
		    <p>For some reason today when I opened up MacVim and hit ,t to navigate to a file, MacVim crashed. The terminal spat out an ugly, and unhelpful error about "deadly signal SEGV", but knowing that I just invoked the Command-T plugin, the error was easy to track down. Command-T is not like other plugins that I have installed with Pathogen, it lives on its own and is not updated as a Git submodule. </p>
<p>To fix the error, all I needed to do is download the latest version of Command-T as a ".vba" file and run through the install again. The install procedure is <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025">fairly simple</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To install open the vimball archive in Vim: </p>
<p>vim command-t.vba </p>
<p>Then source it: </p>
<p><code>:so %</code> </p>
<p>The C extension must also be then compiled; for instance, if Vimball installs your plugin files in ~/.vim, then you would do this: </p>
</blockquote>
<p>{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/.vim/ruby/command-t 
ruby extconf.rb 
make 
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>And now everything is back to normal. Command-T is a great plugin, I recommend it. My latest adventures in Vim are available on <a href="https://github.com/jbuys/MyVim">Github</a>, if you'd like to follow along.</p>
