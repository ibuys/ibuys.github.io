		<h1>A New World</h1>
		    <p>CocoaHeads changed my life. This afternoon I am killing time in a coffee shop, about to head to work for an appointment with HR. When I get there, I'll turn in my badge, they will wish me luck, and I'll walk out the door. Monday, I start a new chapter in my life with <a href="http://www.t8webware.com/">T8 Webware</a>. To say that I'm a little nervous about this change would be an understatement. I've spent time with these guys, they are smart, ambitious, and I believe in what they are doing. I'm going to be part of building something awesome, and I'm extremely excited.</p>
<p>I met the guys from T8 at CocoaHeads months ago. We got to talking, and found that we had mutual interests. We met for lunch, I visited their main office (which is beautiful, by the way), we had lunch again, we talked and talked, and they made me an offer. My life is changing because I took the time to learn something new, and to reach out to others who shared the my interests. <a href="http://farmdogapps.com">Go2</a> will never make me independently wealthy, but it did open up new doors and bring me to meet people and have experiences I would have missed out on otherwise.  </p>
<p>I haven't been to a CocoaHeads meeting lately. Between raising my family and finishing my masters degree, I haven't had the time. Now that things are falling back into place, I think I owe them a visit. </p>
