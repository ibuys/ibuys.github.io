<blockquote>
<p>Outside of a miracle, we are about to enter an era of desperation in the generative AI space. We're two years in, and we have no killer apps — no industry-defining products — other than ChatGPT, a product that burns billions of dollars and nobody can really describe. Neither Microsoft, nor Meta, nor Google or Amazon seem to be able to come up with a profitable use case, let alone one their users actually like, nor have any of the people that have raised billions of dollars in venture capital for anything with "AI" taped to the side — and investor interest in AI is cooling.</p>

<p>Edward Zitron seems to be a rare voice of frustrated reason in the tech industry. He's very critical of AI, and, more and more, I'm thinking rightfully so. OpenAI is spending over $2 to make $1, burning through billions with no path to profitability.</p>
<p>Couple that with the environmental cost of AI (and its just plain awful cousin, crypto currency) and the unreliability of the generated answers, and I'm wondering just where all of this goes in the next year or so.</p>
