		<h1>Goodbye to The Annual Review</h1>
		    <p>John Siracusa hung up his cape today, <a href="http://hypercritical.co/2015/04/15/os-x-reviewed">announcing on his blog</a> that he would no longer be reviewing OS X. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nearly 15 years ago, I wrote my first review of Mac OS X for a nascent “PC enthusiast’s" website called Ars Technica. Nearly 15 years later, I wrote my last. Though Apple will presumably announce the next major version of OS X at WWDC this coming June, I won’t be reviewing it for Ars Technica or any other publication, including the website you’re reading now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a bittersweet moment for those of us who have been following John for over a decade, but it's well deserved, and the volume of work that he's left is a wonderful gift to the community. </p>
<p>John's explanation of Spotlight in the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2005/04/macosx-10-4/9/">OS X 10.4 review</a> was fundamental in my understanding of OS X as not just another Unix system. OS X is something different, something more. I remember this part in particular blowing my mind: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any file i/o that goes through the Tiger kernel will trigger the appropriate metadata importer. This kernel-level integration ensures that the Spotlight indexes are always up to date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read the whole thing, actually, start at the beginning and read every review from <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/1999/12/macos-x-dp2/">DP2</a>to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/10/os-x-10-10/">Yosemite</a>. His unapologetically deep dives into the details of OS X were something I and a lot of other geeks on the Internet looked forward to with each release. </p>
<p>Siracusa's reviews are required reading for anyone wanting a better understanding of how and why their Mac works the way that it does. I'm looking forward to the published, hardcover book, if it ever comes.</p>
