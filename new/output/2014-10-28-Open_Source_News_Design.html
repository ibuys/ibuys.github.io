		<h1>Open Source News Design</h1>
		    <p>Finding good design in open source can be hard, but it’s almost impossible to find in open source news sites. These sites take “reader hostile” to a new level. Take example “A”, Phoronix:</p>
<p><img src="/media/phoronix-ads.png" /></p>
<p>The advertisement completely obstructs the text. Once the ad is closed, which I’m assuming counts as a “click”, the site is not too terrible to read. Of course, it’s no Daring Fireball. </p>
<p>The problem is compounded when using an aggregator site like Linux Today. Initially, it looks like a series of links:</p>
<p><img src="/media/linuxtoday1.png" /></p>
<p>But, as soon as you click on a link, another full screen, text obstructing ad appears.</p>
<p><img src="/media/linuxtoday2.png" /></p>
<p>OK, fine, close the ad, and see that you still have another link to click on to get to the article you want to read.</p>
<p><img src="/media/linuxtoday3.png" /></p>
<p>Now I’m wondering just how much I care about the Debian Civil War (spoiler: not much), but by this time, I’m invested, let’s read that article. Click the Complete Story link.</p>
<p><img src="/media/linuxtoday4.png" /></p>
<p>Nope! Close the ad, and, finally, find the text I was looking for.</p>
<p><img src="/media/linuxtoday5.png" /></p>
<p>Has it really come to this? Apparently.</p>
