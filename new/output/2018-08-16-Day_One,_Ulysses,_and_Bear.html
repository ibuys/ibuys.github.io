		<h1>Day One, Ulysses, and Bear</h1>
		    <p>I’ve been using, and subscribing to, <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a>, <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com">Bear</a>, and <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> for a while now. It seems a bit silly, especially since they all do basically the same thing. On the surface they are all writing apps, but once I start to think a little deeper about them I can see where the differences lay. </p>
<p><em>Ulysses</em></p>
<p>Ulysses is for <em>writing</em>, the act of thinking through ideas and putting them on a page. That’s what it’s designed for, and that’s what it’s best at. That’s why the first draft of my book is in here. In long-form writing and exporting text into multiple formats, Ulysses excels. Even the little features, like <a href="https://ulysses.app/tutorials/goals/">daily writing goals</a>, are geared towards helping you be the best writer you can be. </p>
<p><em>Bear</em></p>
<p>Bear <em>can</em> do most of the things that Ulysses can do, but less elegantly. Bear can store long-form text, but that’s not what it’s designed for, it’s designed to be the notebook you keep in your back pocket. It’s a <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/#features">note-taking app</a>. A storage space for bits of code, a <a href="http://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing/">Zettelkasten</a> for keeping bits of information that I might need some day. There’s quite a bit of overlap between Ulysses and Bear, but the features slightly lean one way or the other, for taking notes in Bear, and writing projects in Ulysses. </p>
<p><em>Day One</em></p>
<p>This is my journal. Day One is <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/category/uses/">a diary app</a>, a place to record and reflect on where you’ve been and what you’ve done throughout the day. It’s my running journal, a record of films I’ve watched and what I thought of them. It’s my ongoing record of my life… travels and all. It’s also, recently, where I’ve started storing my daily work journal. </p>
<p><em>What I’d Lose</em></p>
<p>I suppose the reason I’m using Ulysses less is because I’m not doing quite as much long-form writing. If I got back to blogging regularly, and if I made an effort to work on my book, I’d have more time spent in this app. But, it seems like I need Bear far more often for my day job, and even this text I’m writing now is going to end up in Day One, or maybe on my blog.</p>
<p>If I moved my journaling into this app, I’d lose the end-to-end encryption and location recording that Day One does. Day One makes a note of the weather, the date and time, and address where you recorded the entry. I’d lose all that in moving to Ulysses. </p>
<p>If I moved my note-taking into Ulysses, I feel like I might lose some of the mental separation between my writing and my notes. I’d also lose Bear’s code blocks and syntax highlighting, which I use all the time. I’ve got a lot of little code snippets and command line scripts saved in Bear, and Ulysses just doesn’t capture code blocks the same way. </p>
<p>So, in the end, I’m sticking with the three writing apps. Their role is well-defined, they fit in my workflow, and they’ve earned my trust. I suppose that’s all I can ask for.  </p>
