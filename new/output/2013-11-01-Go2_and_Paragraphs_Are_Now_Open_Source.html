		<h1>Go2 and Paragraphs Are Now Open Source</h1>
		    <p>I see no reason to keep the code for Go2 and Paragraphs to myself. I have no plans to continue developing them, have received no requests for support, and have seen very, very, few sales over the past few months. So, as of now, both <a href="https://github.com/jbuys/Go2">Go2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jbuys/Paragraphs">Paragraphs</a> are released as open source, under the MIT license, available on GitHub. </p>
<p>It is quite likely that there is a <em>ton</em> of bad code in there. Read through at your own risk.</p>
