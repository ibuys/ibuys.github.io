### Technology

All writing on this site is done using Markdown in [BBEdit][1] on a 2017 iMac 5k. The site is generated by [Jekyll][2], and hosted by [Github Pages][3].

### Design

This site uses the Chalk Jekyll theme. A high quality, completely customizable, performant and 100% free blog template for Jekyll built by [Nielsen Ramon][4]. Download it [here][5].

### Culture

I name all my computers after [first generation transformers][6], and my main machine is always Prime. I think a lot about questions that are hard to answer. What is being a full-time connected society doing to us? How can we use new technology for good, how can we make the world a better place?


### Personal


I love meeting new people, and especially love good conversation. If you’d like to get in touch, you can find me on Twitter as [@ibuys][7]. If you are ever around the Midwest, drop me a line and I’ll show you the best coffee shop in town.

> So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

[1 Corinthians 13:13][8]
