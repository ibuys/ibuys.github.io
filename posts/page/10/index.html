Iowa got its first big storm of the winter season yesterday, and as of right now its still going on.  We couldn't go anywhere even if we wanted to.  We got about 13" of snow so far, but the wind gusts up to 50mph are the big problem.  Just about everything is shut down, schools, work places, and even some of the larger roads.<br />
<br />
Good day to get caught up on somethings I've been meaning to get done.

      <p>
        
          <p>My answer to a <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/75476/toolkit-habits-for-linux-network-system-administration">great question</a> over at serverfault.</p>

<p>First off, find your logs. Most Linux distros log to /var/log/messages, although I’ve seen a couple log to /var/log/syslog. If something is wrong, most likely there will be some relevant information in the logs. Also, if you are dealing with email at all, don’t forget /var/log/mail. Double-check your applications, find out if any of them log somewhere ridiculous, outside of syslog.</p>

<p>Brush up on your vi skills. Nano might be what all the cool kids are using these days, but experience has taught me that vi is the only text editor that is guaranteed to be on the system. Once you get used to the keyboard shortcuts, and start creating your own triggers, vi will be like second nature to you.</p>

<p>Read the man page, and then run the following commands on each machine, and copy the results into your documentation:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">    <span class="nb">cat</span> /etc/<span class="k">*</span>release<span class="k">*</span>
    <span class="nb">cat</span> /etc/hosts
    <span class="nb">cat</span> /etc/resolv.conf
    <span class="nb">cat</span> /etc/nsswitch
    <span class="nb">df</span> <span class="nt">-h</span>
    ifconfig <span class="nt">-a</span>
    free <span class="nt">-m</span>
    crontab <span class="nt">-l</span>
    <span class="nb">ls</span> /etc/cron.d
    <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$SHELL</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That will serve as the beginnings of your documentation. Those commands let you know your environment, and can help narrow down problems later on.</p>

<p>Grep through your logs and search for “error” or “failed”. That will give you an idea of what’s not working as it should. Your users will give you their opinion on whats wrong, listen closely to what they have to say. They don’t understand the system, but they see it in a different way than you do.</p>

<p>When you have a problem, check things in this order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Disk Space (df -h): Linux, and some apps that run on Linux, do some very strange things when disk space runs out. It may seem unrelated, until you check and find a filesystem 100% full.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Top: Top will let you know if you’ve got some process that’s stuck out there eating up all of your available CPU cycles. Nothing should consume 99% CPU for any extended period of time. If its a legitimate process, it should probably fluctuate up and down. While you are in top, check…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>System Load: The system load should normally be below 3 on a standard server or workstation. The system load is based on CPU, memory, and I/O.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Memory (free -m): RAM use in Linux is a little different. It’s not uncommon to see a server with nearly all of its RAM used up. Don’t Panic, if you see this, it’s mostly just cache, and will be cleared out as needed. However, pay close attention to the amount of swap in use. If possible, keep this as close to zero as you can. Insufficient memory can lead to all kinds of performance problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Logs: Go back to your logs, run tail -500 /var/log/messages</td>
          <td>more and start reading through and seeing what’s been going on. Hopefully, the logs will be able to point you in the direction you need to go next.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A well maintained Linux server can run for years without problems. We just shut one down that had been running for 748 days, and we only shut it down because we had migrated the application over to new hardware. Hopefully, this will help you get your feet wet, and get you off to a good start.</p>

<p>One last thing, always make a copy of a config file you intend to change, and always copy the line you are changing, and comment out the original, adding your reason for changing it. This will get you into the habit of documenting as you go, and may save your hide 9 months down the road.</p>

          <p>To enable an interface on a web server to be part of an IBM load balanced cluster, we need to be able to share an ip address between multiple machines. This breaks the IP protocol however, because you could never be sure which machine will answer for a request for that IP address. To fix this problem, we need to get down into the IP protocol and investigate how the Address Resolution Protocol or ARP, works.</p>

          <p>Comparing two server operating systems, like SuSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) and RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), needs to answer one question, “what do we want to do with the overall system”? The version of Linux running underneath the application is immaterial, as long as the application supports that version. It is my opinion that we should choose the OS that supports all of our applications, and gives us the best value for our money.</p>

          <p>I’m writing an article for <a href="http://theappleblog.com">TAB</a> about my new blogging engine, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I’ve taken most of the reliance on the command line out of dealing with Jekyll on a day to day basis, and instead have a few Automator workflows in the scripts menu in the Mac menubar. It’s a great setup, I’m really enjoying it. I’m sure there will be quite a bit of enhancement yet to come, but my initial workflow looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click “New Blog Post”</li>
  <li>Write the article</li>
  <li>Click “Run Jekyll”</li>
  <li>Make sure everything worked using the local <a href="http://www.webrick.org/">webrick</a> web server.</li>
  <li>Click “Kill Jekyll”</li>
  <li>Click “Sync Site”</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s what I’ve got so far in the automator workflows:</p>

<h3 id="new-blog-post">New Blog Post</h3>

<p>First, I run the “Ask for Text” action to get the name of the post. Then, I run this script:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>NAME=`echo $1 | sed s/\ /-/g`
USERNAME=`whoami`
POSTNAME=`date "+%Y-%m-%d"-$NAME`
POST_FQN=/Users/$USERNAME/Sites/_posts/$POSTNAME.markdown
touch $POST_FQN
echo "---" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "layout: post" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "title: $1" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
echo "---" &gt;&gt; $POST_FQN
/usr/bin/mate $POST_FQN
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="run-jekyll">Run Jekyll</h3>

<p>First, I run this script:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>USERNAME=`whoami`
cd /Users/$USERNAME/Sites
/usr/bin/jekyll &gt; /dev/null
/usr/bin/jekyll --server  &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
/usr/local/bin/growlnotify --appIcon Automator Jekyll is Done -m 'And there was much rejoicing.'
echo "http://localhost:4000"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Followed by the “New Safari Document” Automator action. This runs Jekyll which converts the blog post I just wrote in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> syntax to html, updates the site navigation, starts the local web server and opens the site in Safari to preview.</p>

<h3 id="kill-jekyll">Kill Jekyll</h3>

<p>Since I start the local server in the last step, I need to kill it in this step. This action does just that.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>PID=`ps -eaf | grep "jekyll --server" | grep -v grep | awk '{ print $2 }'`
kill $PID
/usr/local/bin/growlnotify --appIcon Automator Jekyll is Dead -m 'Long Live Jekyll.'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is entered in as a shell script action, and is the only action in this workflow.</p>

<h3 id="sync-site">Sync Site</h3>

<p>Once I’m certain everything looks good, I run the final Automator action to upload the site:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd /Users/USERNAME/Sites/_site/
rsync -avz -e ssh . USERNAME@jonathanbuys.com:/home/USERNAME/jonathanbuys.com/ &gt; /dev/null
/usr/local/bin/growlnotify --appIcon Automator Site Sync Complete -m 'Check it out.'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is also a single Automator action workflow. You’ll notice that I use <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a> to notify me that the script is finished. This is also not really necessary, but it’s fun anyway.</p>

<p>Like I said, there’s a lot of improvement yet to go, but I think it’s a solid start. I’m at a point now where I’m tempted to start writing a Wordpress import feature, which seems to be the only major piece missing from the Jekyll puzzle. I’m not sure what this would take just yet, but I’ve got a few ideas.  I haven’t tried uploading any images or media yet, but since everything is static, I assume it would just be a matter of placing the image in a /images folder and embedding it in html. So far, I’m having a lot of fun, and that’s what blogging is really all about.</p>

          <p>There’s been times when I’ve walked away from the command line, times when I’ve thought about doing something else for a living.  There’s even been brief periods of time when I’ve flirted with Windows servers.  However, I’ve always come back to Unix, in one form or another.  Starting with Solaris, then OpenBSD, then every flavor of Linux under the sun, to AIX, and back to Linux.  Unix is something that I understand, something that makes sense.</p>

<p>Back in ‘96 when I started in the tech field, I discovered that I have a knack for understanding technology.  Back then it was HF receivers and transmitters, circuit flow and 9600 baud circuits.  Now I’m binding dual gigabit NICs together for additional bandwidth and failover in Red Hat.  The process, the flow of logic, and the basics of troubleshooting still remain the same.</p>

<p>To troubleshoot a system effectively, you need to do more than just follow a list of pre-defined steps.  You need to understand the system, you need to know the deep internals of not only <em>how</em> it works, but <em>why</em>.  In the past 13 years of working in technology, I’ve found that learning the why is vastly more valuable.</p>

<p>Which brings me back to why I love working with Unix systems again.  I understand why they act the way that they do, I understand the nature of the behavior.  I find the layout of the filesystem to be elegant, and a minimally configured system to be best.  I know that there are a lot of problems with the FSH, and I know that it’s been mangled more than once, but still.  In Unix, everything is configured with a text file somewhere, normally in /etc, but from time to time somewhere else.  Everything is a file, which is why tools like lsof work so well.</p>

<p>Yes, Unix can be frustrating, and yes, there are things that other operating systems do better.  It is far from perfect, and has many faults.  But, in the end, there is so much more to love about Unix then there is to hate.</p>

          <p>We are going through a major migration at work, upgrading our four and a half year old IBM blades to brand spanking new HP BL460 G6’s.  We run a web infrastructure, and the current plan is to put our F5’s, application servers, and databases in place, test them all out, and then take a downtime to swing IPs over and bring up the new system.  It’s a great plan, it’s going to work perfectly, and we will have the least amount of downtime with this plan.  Also… I hate it.</p>

<p>The reason I hate it has more to do with technical philosophy then with actual hard facts.  I prefer a slow and steady evolution, a recognition that we are not putting in a static system, but a living organism who’s parts are made up of bits and silicone.  What I’d like to do is put in the database servers first, then swing over the application servers, and then the F5, which is going to replace our external web servers and load balancers.  One part at a time, and if we really did it right, we could do each part with very little downtime at all.  However, I can see the point in putting in everything at once, you test the entire system from top to bottom, make sure it works, and when everyone is absolutely certain that all the parts work together, flip the switch and go live.  But… then what.</p>

<p>What about six months down the road when we are ready to add capacity to the system, what about adding another database server, what about adding additional application servers to spread out the load, what about patches?</p>

<p>Operating systems are not something that you put into place and never touch again.  IT systems made up of multiple servers should not be viewed as fragile, breakable things that should not be touched.  We can’t set this system up and expect it to be the same three years from now when the lease on the hardware is up.  God willing, it’s going to grow, flourish, change.</p>

<p>Our problems are less about technology, and more about our corporate culture.</p>

          <p>As a general rule, I really don’t like consultants.  Not that I have anything against any of them personally, it’s just that as a whole, most consultants I’ve worked with are no better than our own engineers and administrators.  The exception that proves this rule is our recent VMWare consultant, who was both knowledgeable and willing to teach.  Bringing in an outside technical consultant to design, install, or configure a software system is admitting that not only do we as a company not know enough about the software, we don’t plan on learning enough about it either.  Bringing in a consultant is investing in that companies knowledge, and not investing in our own.</p>

          <p>Today I found myself in the unfortunate situation of defending Linux to a man I think I can honestly describe as a Windows zealot.  I hate doing this, as it leads to religious wars that are ultimately of no use, but it’s really my own fault for letting myself be sucked into it.  It started when we were attempting to increase the size of a disk image in vmware, while Red Hat guest was running.  It didn’t work, and we couldn’t find any tools to rescan the scsi bus, or anything else to get Linux to recognize that the disk was bigger.  I was getting frustrated, and the zealot began to laugh, saying how easy this task was in Windows.  Obviously, I felt slighted since I’m one of the Unix admins at $work, and decided I needed to defend the operating system and set of skills that pays the bills here at home.  And so, we started trading snide remarks back and forth about Linux and Windows.</p>

      <p>
        
          <p>One of the features of Servers.app is that it pings the host and shows a little indicator for it’s status: green is good, red is dead.  Getting that little feature in here was not quite as easy as I thought it would be.  After searching the Apple documentation for what seemed like years, I stumbled across SimplePing.  It was perfect, exactly what I was looking for.  I dropped the two source code files into into my project, read through the documentation commented out in the header file and added the code to call SimplePing.  It worked, and everything seemed fine.  Except that it kept working, even when I knew for certain that the host did not exist.</p>

<p>So, I started digging through the source code for SimplePing.c, and found that instead of calling a standard error message, it called <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/functions/perror.html">perror</a>, which, according to the documentation, doesn’t return a value.  This is fine if you want to log the ping results, but I wanted to ping the server and make a decision based on code.  So, I changed a couple of lines of code from this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if (error == 0) //was able to wait for reply successfully (whether we got a reply or not)
{
    if (gotResponse == 1)
    {
		{numberPacketsReceived = numberPacketsReceived + 1;}
	}
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if (error == 0) //was able to wait for reply successfully (whether we got a reply or not)
{
    if (gotResponse == 1)
	{
		{numberPacketsReceived = numberPacketsReceived + 1;}
	} else {
		error = 1;
	}
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Simply adding an extra else statement in there to return an error code gave my application something to work with.  Now, from my application controller I can call SimplePing like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>int systemUp;
systemUp = SimplePing(cString, 2, 2, 1);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that, I can make decisions based on the value of the systemUp int.   Now, it’s entirely possible that I’m doing this wrong, all I can say is that it works for me now, and it didn’t before.</p>

Apple has been <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/04/23/apple-says-no-to-netbook-quietly-nods-yes-to-tablet/">adamant</a> that it is not interested in the netbook market, but according to the many users who are breaking Apple’s EULA and installing OS X on Dell Minis, the market is there, and waiting.</p>

<p>Rumors have been circulating for <a href="http://theappleblog.com/tag/netbook/">some time now</a> that Apple is working on a netbook.  I wish I had some special insight or access to Apple’s inner-workings so I could confirm or deny those rumors, but all I can say is <em>I hope so</em>. To get everyone on the same page here, let me explain exactly what I mean when I say an Apple netbook. I’m talking about a small device with a ten inch (or smaller) screen, small physical keyboard, reduced hardware specs, running a legal, full copy of OS X. I’m not talking about an iPhone, or some kind of iPhone/MacBook hybrid. While its not clear if Apple would consider such a device or not, what is clear is that people would buy a $500 MacBook Nano (or NetMac?) in droves.</p>

          <p>I’ve put a lot of work into this site.  I’ve put thought into how I want the URLs to look, how the layout should feel, and since the site has my name on it, I wanted it to be good.  I created a custom theme for the site which will purposefully only work here, and I’ve even done a bit of personal “branding” I suppose with the jb{ logo.</p>

<p>So, when I saw that Digg had decided to take a page out of 1999’s web play book and start framing sites inside of their DiggBar, I was more than a little annoyed.  There may be only six people who read this site on a regular basis (Thanks guys!), but this site is entirely mine.  The DiggBar removes the URL from the site you are reading and adds it’s own custom shortened URL, making it hard to bookmark, or really even remember where you are.</p>

          <p>When I was younger, 20 years ago or so I suppose, the New Kids On The Block
(NKOTB) were synonymous with cheesy pop music that was taking over our
airwaves. They weren’t just a pop boy band, they were The pop boy band. I
remember the thing was that if you were a guy and you were a NKOTB fan, it
instantly meant you were gay. Which, for an adolescent boy just before his
teens, that meant there was absolutely no way that this band’s music would
ever willingly land on his ears. Rumors circulated regularly about the NKOTB
being caught, red-handed no less, in one disgusting sexual tryst or another.
One in particular that I remember was that one of the members had to have his
stomach pumped because he was sick, and they found that it was full of sperm.
That was the stigma attached to this band.</p>

          <p>I’ve been using Linux for nearly a decade now. I first had a guy I met in a Navy school install it on my old IBM desktop. Back then, it was very hard to find the right drivers, and just about impossible to get on the Internet, seeing how almost every modem that shipped with a PC was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmodem">WinModem</a>. X11 configuration was error prone to say the least, drivers for the sound card were hard to come by, and out in the rural English countryside where we lived, broadband was almost unheard of. Installing software could be a nightmare. Say I wanted to install a music player to listen to my CDs. The music player would have dependencies, certain libraries that needed to be installed, so I’d go and download the dependencies and try to install them, only to find out that the dependencies had dependencies! So, I’d download further dependencies, and eventually I’d be able to listen to my music. And then I’d try to launch something else, only to find out that in fulfilling the dependencies of the music player, I’d broken the dependencies of the other application that <em>used</em> to be installed and working.</p>

      <p>
        
          <p>Ask any mechanic, machinist, or carpenter what the single most important thing that contributes to their success is, and what they are bound to tell you is “having the right tool for the job”.  Humans excel in creating physical tools to accomplish a certain task.  From hammers to drive a nail to the Jaws of Life to pry open a car, the right tool will save time, money, and frustration.  It’s interesting to note the contrast that people have such a hard time with <em>conceptual</em> tools.  Software designed to accomplish a specific task, or several tasks, is often forced into a role that it may not fit into, making the experience kludgy, like walking through knee deep mud.</p>

<p>I’ve found this problem to be especially prevalent in business environments, where the drive to “collaborate” brings many varied and sundry applications into the mix.  While hurrying to the next great collaboration tool they forget to ask the absolute most important question: <em>What do we need this software to do?</em></p>

<p>To communicate effectively in a business environment, it is imperative to use the right tool for the job.  To determine what the right tool for the job is, you first have to ask yourself exactly what the job is.  Do you need ask a quick, immediate question from a co-worker?  Is there a more detailed project question that you need to ask, and maybe get the opinions of a few others too?  Do you have something that you need to let a large group of people know, maybe even the entire company?  Each of these tasks is best suited to a different tool.  Unfortunately, I’ve most often seen each of these tasks shoe-horned into email.</p>

<p>Email is a personal communications medium, best suited for projects or questions that you do not need immediate responses to.  There have been many times when I’ve gone through my inbox and found something that didn’t grab my attention when it was needed, and by the time I looked at it was past due.  Email is asynchronous, ask a question, and wait for a response whenever the receiving party has time.</p>

<p>If you do need immediate response, the best tool would be instant messaging.  IM pops up and demands the receiving person’s attention.  When requesting something via IM, the person on the other end has to make a decision either to ignore you or to answer your question.  Long explanations are not a good fit for IM, but short, two or or three sentence conversations are perfect or it.</p>

<p>When considering sending something out to the entire company, keep in mind that email is a <em>personal</em> communications medium.  Company wide email blasts are impersonal, and for the most part require no action on the part of the receiver other than to eventually read it.  A better tool for this job is an internal company blog, accompanied by an RSS feed.  RSS is built into all major browsers now, and could be built into the base operating system build for PCs.  Every single time I get something from our company green team or an announcement from the CEO, I can’t help but think that a blog would be the best place for such formal, impersonal communications.  A blog could be archived for searching, new announcements broadcast through RSS, and best of all accessible when the intended receiver has the time and attention to best appreciate the content.  To me, company wide email is the same thing as spam, and for the most part, is treated as such.</p>

<p>One other form of internal communications which is far, far too often maligned beyond recognition is shared documentation.  Technical documentation especially suffers from document syndrome, which is having a separate (often) Word file for each piece of documentation, spread out through several different directories on Windows shares, or worse on the local hard drive of whoever wrote it.  Such documentation should be converted to a wiki as soon as possible.  If you are writing a book, I hear Word is a fairly good tool to use.  If you are writing a business letter, again, great tool.  If you are documenting the configuration of a server, a word processor should not be launched.  Word (or OpenOffice) documents have a tendency to drift, and are difficult to access unless you are on the internal network.  Trying to access a windows share from my Mac at home through the VPN is something that I’ve never even considered trying.  A wiki, is perfectly suited for internal documentation.  They are a single central place to organize all documents in a way that makes sense, is accessible from a web browser, easy to keep up to date, and most importantly, searchable.  Need to know how to set up Postfix?  Search the internal wiki.  Need to know why this script creates a certain file?  Search the internal wiki.  Everything should be instantly searchable.  Perhaps search is not the most important feature of a wiki, perhaps the most important is the ability to link to other topics according to context.  I can get lost in Wikipedia at times, jumping from one link to another as I explore a topic.  The same thing can happen to internal documentation.  This script creates this document for this project, which is linked to an explanation of the project, which contains links to other scripts and further explanation.  Creating the documentation can seem time consuming, until you are there at 2AM trying to figure out why a script stopped working.  Then the hour spent writing the explanation at 2PM doesn’t seem so bad.</p>

<p>One of the first things I did when starting my job was to set up both a personal, internal blog and a shared wiki for documentation.  I used Wordpress for the blog, and MediaWiki for the wiki.  Both are excellent tools, and very well suited for their purpose.  If I were a manager, I’d encourage my team to spend 15 minutes or so at the end of the day posting what they did for the day in their personal blog.  Could you imagine the gold mine you’d have at the end of a year or so?  Or the resources for  justifying raises.  Solid documented experience with products and procedures, what works and what doesn’t.  The employee’s brain laid out.</p>

<p>Internal moderated forums is something that I haven’t tried yet, but I can see benefits to this as well.  They’ve been used on the Internet for years, and I can imagine great possibilities there, especially for problem resolution.  How about a forum dedicated to the standard OS build of PCs?  Or one for discussing corporate policies?</p>

<p>Blogs, wikis, forums, and IM are tools who’s tasks are far too often wedged into email.  If an entire organization begins to leverage using the right tool for the job, the benefits would soon become apparent.  Then you’d wonder why you ever did it the other way at all.</p>

          <p>My co-worker and I spent the better part of yesterday afternoon going through a former employee’s shell scripts to try to determine what they were and what he was trying to do.

    <p>Always, always, always start off each and every script with a shbang line: <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="c">#!/bin/sh</span></code>. Starting off your script with this line tells your shell where to find the interpreter for the commands in the script. Without this line, the script is using your user’s existing shell, the one you are typing in at the moment. This is bad because you are sharing environmental variables, and maybe changing environmental variables outside of your script, and not keeping it self contained and portable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep your script self contained: If at all possible, try to avoid writing files in different directories. Or, even better, try to avoid writing files at all. Use variables when you can, write files when you have to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid sourcing other scripts or files containing functions: I read about this method in <a href="http://www.intuitive.com/wicked/">Wicked Cool Shell Scripts</a>, but I disagree that it is as useful as they say. Writing a custom function to send an email is a great idea. separating it out of the script you are working on at the time is not. Again, keep the script self contained. There are obvious exceptions to this rule. If your function is over 50 lines of code, and reused in multiple other scripts, then by all means, source it. If your function is 10 lines, create a <a href="http://grox.net/doc/unix/exrc.php">vi shortcut for it</a> and add it to the top of the script.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Comment tasks: Each block of code in your shell script is meant for a specific task. Add a comment for this block. Make it easy to read, and simple to understand. Assume that you will not work there forever, and someone else will need to read your code and make sense out of it. Also assume that in a year, you will forget everything you did and why you did it and need a reminder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep it simple: Scripts should flow logically from top to bottom. If you are creating functions, make it obvious using a comment. Reading a script should be as easy as reading a book, if it’s not, then you are intentionally making things overly complicated and difficult to read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>End each script with <code class="highlighter-rouge">#EOF</code>: This is purely a matter of taste, but I find it adds a nice closure to the script.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The easiest thing to do is to create another script who’s purpose in life is to create new scripts. Couple this script with a vi shortcut (mine is ,t) to create the skeleton of the script and you can quickly create powerful, well formatted, easy to read scripts. Here’s an example of mine:</p>

<p>This article doesn’t talk about syntax, only style. There’s plenty of help with syntax available on the Intertubes. Also, this is <em>my</em> style, as you progress as a sysadmin or scripter of some sort or another, you are bound to come up with your own style that suits you. My style is based on the documentation at grox.net. My style has evolved over time, as will yours, but this is a good place to start.</p>

      <p>
        
          <p>From time to time I’m asked by members of my family or friends of mine outside the tech industry what it is that I do for a living. When I respond that I’m a sysadmin, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_administrator">systems administrator</a> for <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Linux</a> and <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/software/aix/index.html">UNIX</a> servers, more times than not I get the “deer in the headlights” look that says I may as well be speaking Greek. So, for a while, I’ve taken to saying “I work in IT”, or “I work with computers, really big computers” or even “I’m a computer programmer”, which isn’t exactly accurate. Although I do write scripts, or even some moderate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">perl</a>, I’m still not officially a programmer. I’m a systems administrator, so, let me try to explain, my dear friends and family, what it is I do in my little box all day.</p>

<p>First, some basics, let’s start at square one. Computers are comprised of two parts, hardware and software. Sort of like the body and soul of a person.  Without hardware, software is useless, and vice-versa. The most basic parts of the hardware are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cpu">CPU</a>, which is the brain, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM">RAM</a>, which is the memory, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_drive">disk</a>, which is a place to put things, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_card">network card</a>, which lets you talk to other computers. For each of these pieces of hardware there needs to be some way to tell them how to do what they are intended to do. Software tells the hardware what to do. I forgot two important pieces of hardware: the screen and the keyboard/mouse. They let us interact with the computer, at least until I can just tell it what to do <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUbZ8CHVCSE&amp;feature=related">Star Trek</a> style.</p>

<p>Getting all of these pieces of hardware doing the right thing at the right time is complicated, and requires a structured system, along with rules that govern how people can interact with the computer. This system is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">Operating System</a> (OS). There are many popular operating systems: Windows, <a href="http://www.apple.com">OS X</a>, and Linux are the big three right now. The OS tells the hardware what to do, and allows the user to add other applications (programs) to the computer.</p>

<p>Smaller computers, like your home desktop or laptop have network cards to get on the Internet. The network card will be either wired or wireless, that doesn’t really matter. When you get on the Internet, you can send and receive information to and from other computers. This information could be an email, a web page, music, or lots of other media. Most of the time, you are getting this information from a large computer, or large group of computers that give out information to lots of home computers just like yours. Since these computers “serve” information, they are referred to as Servers.</p>

<p>Large servers are much like your home computer. They have CPU, RAM, disk, etc… They just have more of it. The basics still apply though. Servers have their own operating system, normally either Windows, Linux or UNIX. Some web sites or web services (like email) can live on lots of different servers, each server having its own job to do to make sure that you can load a web page in your browser. To manage, or “administer” these servers is my job. I administer the system that ensures the servers are doing what they are supposed to do. I am a systems administrator. It is my responsibility to make sure that the servers are physically where they are supposed to be (a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center">data center</a>, in a rack), that they have power and networking, that the OS is installed and up to date, and that the OS is properly configured to do its job, whatever that job may be.</p>

<p>I am specifically a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UNIX-HATERS_Handbook">UNIX sysadmin</a>, which means that I’ve spent time learning the UNIX interface, which is mostly text typed into a terminal, and it looks a lot like code. This differs from Windows sysadmins, who spend most of their time in an interface that looks similar to a Windows desktop computer. UNIX has evolved into Linux, which is more user friendly and flexible, and also where I spend most of my time.</p>

<p>Being a sysadmin is a good job in a tech driven economy. I’ve got my <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/2008/10/end-of-an-era-2/">reservations about its future</a>, but I may be wrong. Even if I’m not, the IT field changes so rapidly that I’m sure what I’m doing now is not what I’ll be doing 5-10 years from now. One of these days, maybe I’ll open a coffee shop or a restaurant, or I’ll finally write a book.</p>

      <p>
        
          <p>A few days ago I decided that I was not going to use anyone else’s theme on my site. It happened after I stumbled across another site using the exact same theme as mine. Unavoidable really, as long as you are using someone else’s theme. So, the decision was to either stop using Wordpress, or to design my own theme. I love Wordpress, so I decided to go with the latter.</p>

<p>Designing a web site is a strange mix of code and graphic design. In my case, I’ve had to go back to php, a language I left a long time ago, and start learning CSS.  Since I’ve been fooling around in Cocoa for quite a while, going back to php is just <em>painful</em>. Objective-C is a beautiful programming language. Mixing php and html… well, that’s just plain ugly. However, that being said, it’s familiar territory, so I almost feel like I’m coming home. One concept that I’ve learned with Cocoa is the Modal-View-Controller method, basically separating out the presentation code from the application code (yes, I know there is a lot, lot, lot more to it than that… no I’m not going to get into it here), using CSS kind of reminds me of the MVC method, in your php/xhtml code you define what objects are going to be displayed, and in CSS you define where and how to display them. I like the separation… keeps it clean.</p>

<p>At any rate, I’ve been busy coming up with the overall look and feel of the site. One thing I believe about software is that simplicity always wins. At least where I’m concerned it does, that’s why I use a lot of the apps that I use, because they are simple to use. Think about the Google home page. Simple, and it wins.</p>

<p>I’d appreciate any comments on the design, and please keep in mind this is only a very early mockup. Also, I’m going to be using this as my avatar for everywhere that I’ve got an account online: A <a href="http://www.johnmparks.com/">friend</a> of mine, who actually is a designer, laughed when I told him about the tools I’ve been using to do the design so far. First, the initial concept was created in <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/OmniGraffle/">OmniGraffle</a>. From OmniGraffle, I’d export it as a Photoshop file and open it in <a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a> to add the leaves and other touch ups. Right now, that’s as far as I’ve got. I’ll finish the design in the next couple of days, and then move into chopping the file up and getting deep into some code. Hopefully, I’ll have this finished in two or three weeks.</p>

          <p>For better or worse, we are starting to put Ubuntu JeOS images into production in our network.  Starting off, we will only put these systems in for our non-IBM services, no WebSphere or DB2, as IBM doesn’t officially support this configuration yet, but for everything else, JeOS looks like a perfect fit.</p>
