          <p>If you take a moment to look around the room you are in now, what do you see?
Are you surrounded by things that matter, and were built by people who care?
Or, more likely, are you surrounded by mass produced, assembly line, imported
goods that you honestly don’t believe will last all that long? I’ve been
thinking about <a href="https://jonathanbuys.com/06-16-2010/quality.html">quality</a>
again, and how it applies to me, to what I do, and how I spend my time.</p>

          <p>Readability is a subscription based service that allows you to read the text off of websites in a beautiful, clean, consistent interface.  Since I started reading the web through Readability a while ago, I’ve appreciated it’s <em>consistency</em>, meaning that one site looks the same as the next, as the next, and the next. Reading articles on the web becomes more about the writing, and less about design. Jumping from site to site can be jarring, distracting, but when using Readability, the entire web can feel like a single book, one with many chapters.</p>

          <p>Like many who are interested enough in the tech industry to attempt to stay up to date on current happenings, I’ve been struggling with an ever increasing number of interesting sites and feeds. In the past I would categorize the feeds into folders with names like “Blogs”, “News”, “Design”, and “Friends”, but eventually I’d wind up with a folder with a name like “MetaBlogs” or some such ridiculousness. While the multiple folders did help to organize the feeds, they did not help with what I needed; keeping up with what was important.</p>

          <p>It’s snowing again, which means my normal 40-minute commute will now be closer to an hour.

          <p>This past Thursday I was privileged to speak at our local
<a href="http://cocoaheads.org/us/DesMoinesIowa/index.html">CocoaHeads</a> about my
history, and how I was able to bring my app to market. Since someone on
Twitter asked for <a href="http://public.iwork.com/document/?d=CocoaHeads_Presentation.key&amp;a=p62622474">my slides</a>, which don’t amount to much, I thought writing up
my experiences would be a little more useful.</p>

          <p>Yesterday, Go2 was one of approximately 1000 applications available on launch day of the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/go2/id407815526?mt=12">Mac App Store</a>. It’s been a nerve wracking experience, but overall I’m pretty happy so far with the way its gone.  I’ve been able to identify a couple of last minute bugs and get their fixes incorporated into version 1.1, which I’ve had in beta testing for about a month now.</p>

          <p>Word leaked out yesterday that Yahoo has it’s popular Delicious bookmarking service <a href="http://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/15483488237002752">on the chopping block</a>.  I don’t personally have an account, not anymore, so the closing won’t affect me. Twitter tells a different story, my stream lit up with people upset about the decision.  Yahoo’s leak, coupled with their announcement that the company is <a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20101215/heres-carol-bartzs-internal-layoff-memo-to-beleaguered-yahoo-troops/">laying off 4% of it’s workforce</a> right before Christmas, caused a fairly good sized migration from Delicious to <a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a>.  I do have a Pinboard account, and I think I even have a few bookmarks saved, but its been weeks since the last time I visited the site.</p>

          <p>It’s now the middle of December, which signals the end of my first semester of
grad school. I took two classes, both focused on HCI: cognitive psychology and
social implications. The paper I just finished writing for the social
implications course was about answering the question of whether all software
should be free, and required a lot of research into open source, the Free
Software Foundation, and a lot of deep thinking about what I felt was right.</p>

          <p>I should have known better… I do know better, but it was on sale, and it was Black Friday, and I bought an Android phone.  I purchased the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2f3jfhm">HTC Desire</a>, a perfectly reasonable choice in high-end smart phones.  Android 2.1, a 1GHz processor, 512M of RAM, and an 8G MicroSD card for storage.  The phone is well designed, solidly built, and aesthetically pleasing, but at this point, its still on probation, I might take it back.</p>

          <p>Living out in the farmland of Iowa where we do, there’s really only one carrier who provides decent service, <a href="http://www.uscellular.com/uscellular/cell-phones/showPhones.jsp?type=phones&amp;phone-selector-category=phone-selector-android&amp;_requestid=765022">US Cellular</a>.  US Cellular has a great service for battery replacement.  If you find yourself out and about and your battery dies, you can drop by any US Cellular store and they will replace the battery for free.  I was in that situation today, so I spent some time looking at the Android phones HTC Desire and Samsung Mesmerize.</p>

          <p>I’ve been using different forms of computer “chat” for over ten years now, starting with operator-to-operator communications over a 9600baud satcom circuit in the Navy.  Over time, I’ve become used to using certain forms of “emoticons” to convey subtle nuances in the conversation that are unnecessary in face to face communications. I even have friends with whom I communicate with entirely over chat.</p>

          <p>Last night I did my civic duty by casting my vote at the local community center.  I walked down since it was not far from my house, and enjoyed the crisp night air.  Once I arrived at the community center I noticed that the voting process was being run by a group of elderly women, two of whom had Lenovo laptops, which were curiously tied together by an ethernet cable.  Each of the laptops had a label printer attached to it via USB, with the other USB port occupied by a mouse.  As I approached one lady noticed me and asked me to fill out a form, which I did, and then asked if I had voted there before, which I had not.  That turned out to be a bit of a problem, one that was easily resolved, and one that was caused entirely by the laptops.</p>

          <p>So, last night, when I should have been sleeping, I had an idea. What if, instead of going to a bank to get a loan, you could ask a few of your Internet friends for a loan instead?  Say you want $1000 for a new iMac, you go to some imaginary website and tell it how much you want. This website does a quick credit check to get your credit score, and then determines your interest rate based on that score.

          <p>A long, long time ago, what seems like a different life now, I was a Sailor.
Towards the end of my teenage years, I came to a point where I knew I had to
do something with my life, and at the time, that something was not college. My
adoptive father was in the Navy, so I decided to follow in his footsteps and
joined the Navy myself in October of 1995. From June of 1996 to July of 1999 I
was assigned to the USS Platte, an oiler. During this time I made the best
friends of my life, met my wife, and travelled across Europe and even into the
Middle East.</p>

          <p>We’ve been having a months long discussion at work around which Linux OS to
use. It’s all come to a head recently, and it looks like the winner is going
to be Red Hat. The decision leaves a slightly sour taste in my mouth, but over
the course of the past year I’ve gotten used to having it around. While trying
to understand why I’ve got such a dislike for this particular flavor of Linux,
I thought it might help to take another look at <a href="http://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>.</p>

      <p>
        
          <p>I’ve been writing online since around 2000, starting with a <a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com/">geocities</a> site. After that, I had a <a href="http://www.50megs.com/">50megs.com</a> site that offered <em>gasp</em> 50 Megabytes of online storage! (Just noticed, they still do!)  After a couple of years, I noticed a company named <a href="http://1and1.com">1and1</a> that was offering three years of free hosting and the domain of your choice. That was a deal I couldn’t pass up, and I grabbed the domain name sourceport.org. I used the domain, but didn’t get a whole lot accomplished with it. I used it for a while to sell PCs as firewalls with <a href="http://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>, but that didn’t end well, so then I started a <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> blog with that domain name. Unfortunately, the person who owns the sourceport dot com address had a beef with me, so I moved the blog over to a new domain: jonstechblog.com. While I was using this blog, I moved away from wordpress and started using a Mac application named <a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver">RapidWeaver</a>. I switched to RapidWeaver because it made the task of posting videos of Linux distros that I was testing out easy. I was testing the distros anyway, so I figured, why not share it with the world.</p>

<p>One day, I got an email from the guys at <a href="http://shots.osdir.com/">OSDir</a>, asking about a “link exchange”. It turns out he thought I was on to something, and that he was toying with the same idea. He donated all of his videos to me, we exchanged links, and osvids.com was born. OSVids was a big hit, and got very popular very fast, starting with an interview I did with Tina Gasperson from NewsForge.</p>

<p>It turns out that the site grew too popular too fast. When I first started uploading the videos, I was encoding them with quicktime, which turned out to be a very bad idea from a usability standpoint for my target audience. The Linux crowd demanded an open format, so I offered downloads in <a href="http://www.vorbis.com">Ogg-Vorbis</a> format in addition to switching to the more widely deployed flash. Starting out with Quicktime had another very bad side effect: bandwidth. The quicktime files were huge, and I went from a negligible bandwidth use to 1.5 Terabytes in one month. This took a toll on my wallet in a big way. I noticed an advertisement for a hosting company that claimed “Unlimited Bandwidth!”, so I signed up and moved OSVids over to their servers. Another bad idea. I learned quickly that there is no such thing as “unlimited bandwidth”, as OSVids quickly brought there servers to a screeching halt. I complained, they tried to respond, and eventually I moved the site back over to 1and1. Even on shared hosting, 1and1’s servers never skipped a beat, and I never had any downtime with them. But, like I said, I paid for it.</p>

<p>I kept up the site for a few months steadily adding videos of new distros as they were released. Then, several things happened in my personal and professional life that caused OSVids to begin a slow but steady decline. The most major item was the loss of hardware. Through some unfortunate events, I lost the nice IBM laptop that I was using to create the videos. I tried using my Mac, but the resolution was too low on the iBook, and even after upgrading to a MacBook, the resolution was far too low. In addition, we sold our house, moved to a new state, I had to find a new job, and we had some semi-serious in-law issues. The biggest news was finding out that we were expecting. So, I tried several different approaches to make OSVids work, but in the end I had to shut the site down. Not because it didn’t get any traffic, it did, but… it was an <em>open loop that needed to be closed</em>, and I couldn’t find anyone who wanted to take the time to do all the video encoding and manual coding of the web site that made OSVids run. I lost most of the data from the site, but what I found I uploaded to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/osvids">YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>I started this blog a few months after loosing OSVids. I needed to completely reboot my online presence. I found that what I really needed was more time offline, to really think about why I wanted to write, and what I wanted to write about. After some thought, I’ve decided on a simple blog hosted here on github.</p>

<p>I’ve been inspired by <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>, and <a href="http://diveintomark.org">Dive into Mark</a>, and a host of other great sites. I hope that over the years as my writing voice develops I’ll be able to look back on what I’ve written here and see my work progress. I do not write this blog for it to be popular, I write it because I love to write.</p>

<p>The loss of OSVids was unfortunate, but really inevitable. Even without my life going nuts at the time, the rise of YouTube, Google Video, and all the other video sharing sites quickly made my hand-coding and inability to accept submissions from fans obsolete. Perhaps there is still room for OSVids. I still own the osvids.net domain, and I’ve been contemplating bringing it back. For now, I’ve really come full circle, but as a much more experienced writer. In the end, its just me and my blog, but if you’d care to join me, I’d love to have you.</p>

          <p>As a carpenter has his tools, so do I, as a “knowledge worker” have my computer. I spend many hours a day with my Mac. I have my workflow honed and finely tuned, and I know when something is wrong with my computer, when there is more friction than there needs to be. I am a Systems Administrator, so my knowledge work is to ensure that other people can get their work done. My job is to keep the servers, services, and systems I support up and running 24x7. The tools I use to get this job done mean a lot to me, and over the years I’ve tried many of them with varying levels of success. I know exactly what my ideal setup is, and I’m working towards filling out my toolbox with the very best as I strive to bring my craft to the next level of mastery.</p>

<p>At home, my computer is college, entertainment, finance, photos, blogging, and fun. Mostly fun. There have been times when I’ve walked away from even owning a computer at home, seeing it as a distraction more than anything, but I always come back to wanting one around, if for nothing else than as an outlet for creativity.</p>

<p>In the years that I’ve been using computers, I’ve found that I desire simplicity more than configurability. Favoring fewer options over more. The machine I use needs to be beautiful to look at, because I spend a lot of time looking at it. It needs to be simple to use, because I have work to do, photos to edit, words to write, and I don’t want to have to mess with anti-virus updates or X windows crashing because of some beta driver bug that made its way into the mainstream release. I just want my computer to let me do what needs to be done.</p>

<p>Beautifully designed and crafted, simple to use, powerful… my computer needs to be a Mac. No one else on the market can release a computer that matches a Mac. I’m not sure why, it’s like they don’t know how. They try, but they fail.</p>

<p>Open source operating systems like Ubuntu are not as good because there are far too many cooks in the kitchen. Ubuntu is not an operating system like OS X is an operating system. It’s the Linux kernel, the ext4 filesystem, the Xwindow system, the Gnome desktop, the Firefox browser, and thousands of other open source packages and applications that work loosely together, and are developed by different teams. OS X is developed by Apple.</p>

<p>Windows XP is a suitable operating system to work with at the office, but I am far more productive on a Mac. With tools like Yojimbo, Spotlight, and Quicklook, Macs are far better suited for information management. I hear Windows 7 is nice. My wife has it on her PC, and so far, it is still just a PC.</p>

<p>As much as I love Macs for their design and ease of use, I also see the faults of some business decisions Apple has made in the past few years. The App Store is either a resounding success or a horrible failure, depending on who you talk to. In sheer volume, 200,000 apps is a lot of applications, but like Windows was last decade, most of them are crap. Apple’s decision to approve each app in the store is admirable to a degree, but they are not executing well at all. Some people are philosophically opposed to the app store, saying that the iPod/IPad/iPhone ecosystems should be open for any application to run on them, as is the case on the Mac. I do not care about this aspect, but I do wish that Apple would fix their approval process to make the system much more transparent. There should be clear cut guidelines on what is acceptable and what is not, and those guidelines should be applied across the board. Random app store rejections are the running gag of the current implementation. Its wrong, and it needs to be fixed.</p>

<p>Is the Apple today the same as the Apple so many fell in love with in the ’80s and ’90s?  The scrappy underdog that just won’t die?  No, and I couldn’t care less. I find it interesting that the era that some romanticize is actually one of the worst in the history of the company. Back when Apple was allowing clones and releasing crap with the Apple logo on it. Good riddance to bad rubbish. OS 9 was not interesting to me. OS X is.</p>

<p>I was using Linux and OpenBSD when I first heard of OS X, my first iBook was a revelation. Finally, someone had put a decent GUI on a Unix box. Apple has only gotten better from there.</p>

<p>I know there are a lot of very smart people who disagree with me. Lets let the next twenty years decide who is right.</p>

<p>Along with the app store debacle, there is Apple’s stance on Flash. My personal feeling is that if Flash were a true open standard, if anyone could create Flash applications without relying on Adobe, it’d be a whole different ball game. As it is, Flash is controlled by Adobe in its entirety, and that seems wrong for the Internet. The Web is the great leveling field, a mechanic in Kansas has the same chance of creating an awesome web site as a multi-billion dollar corporation. All the tools to create amazing web sites are free, and the specs for building the sties are readily available. All you need is a computer, Internet access, and a text editor. With Flash, you need some pretty expensive software. Also, having run a video serving site in the past, I can tell you that HTML 5 would have been a Godsend back then. It would have been so much simpler to just drop a .mov or .ogg file enclosed in video tags than the junk code I had to put in.</p>

<p>I’d like to watch Hulu on my iPad. Netflix already rocks on it. Flash is not a necessity.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s Google. I used to love Google, back when it was a search engine. They could have been happy with just being the best search engine in the world, and making billions, hand over fist, but no… they had to go and get greedy. Eric Schmidt sat on the Apple board of directors and saw what Apple was doing, and thought to himself… Google could do that. So, they “stabbed Apple in the back”, and released Android, and then the Nexus One, a direct competitor to Apple’s iPhone. Bad form, old boy, bad form indeed.</p>

<p>Also, I don’t like Google’s business model any more. I used to be fine with it, when they would show ads on the search results. Now though, Google wants to watch everything you do online, and figure out a way to monazite your activity. Your email, calendar, RSS feeds, photographs, friends, chats, videos, music, there’s even Google Health where you can put your medical record in Google. It all goes into the big black box that is Google, to be analyzed for who knows how long. Me, I like to be a little more honesty with my transactions. That’s why I pay for my email service. I give Apple money, they give me an email address, and a few other perks. It’s as simple as it gets.</p>

<p>I think that about does it for the major topics of the day. Of course, in all these things, I might be wrong. However, if I am wrong, and you want to call me out on it, I suggest you do your homework first. I’ve done mine. I have several years of experience, and a finely honed sense of craftsmanship.</p>

<p>I am, after all, strongly opinionated.</p>

      <p>
        
          <p>We don’t have a very big Nagios installation, comparatively anyway, but it is big enough to find that the default layout for configurations is insane.  I tried using the provided layout, until I wound up with single text files with thousands of lines in them. This made it very hard to do individual customizations for servers, and separating out who wants to be notified for what.  Here is what I came up with for managing our Nagios configs.</p>

<p>It seems that the repositories are always behind in Nagios, so it is one of the very few apps that I recommend installing from source.  I install Nagios in /usr/local/nagios, the default when compiling, I’ll just call it $nag.  The Nagios binary is in $nag/bin, the plugins in $nag/libexec, and the config files in $nag/etc. The easiest way to understand nagios is to follow its start up procedures.  I keep an /etc/init.d/nagios file for initialization, The file defines, among other things, where the home directory for Nagios is, what config file to use as its base, and where the Nagios binary and plugins are.  The important thing to understand is that this file is the first pointer in a long string of pointers that Nagios uses for configuration.</p>

<p>Inside the nagios.cfg file are the cfg_dir directives.  These are pointers that tell Nagios that it can find additional configurations inside the directories listed.   Once Nagios is given a directory to look at, it will read each file ending in .cfg inside of that directory.  The first directory that I have listed is $nag/etc/defaults.  I keep four files in this directory: commands.cfg, dependencies.cfg, generic.cfg, and timeperiods.cfg.</p>

<p>The file “commands.cfg” contains the definitions of all check commands that Nagios can understand.  They look like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> # 'check_local_load' command definition
 define command{
        command_name    check_local_load
        command_line    $USER1$/check_load -w $ARG1$ -c $ARG2$
        }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The file also contains the alert commands, or what Nagios will do when it finds something that it needs to let you know about:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>define command{
command_name notify-by-email
command_line	/usr/bin/printf "%b" "***** Nagios *****\n\nNotification Type: 	$NOTIFICATIONTYPE$\nHost: $HOSTNAME$\nState: $HOSTSTATE$\nAddress: 	$HOSTADDRESS$\nInfo: $HOSTOUTPUT$\n\nDate/Time: $LONGDATETIME$\n" | /usr/	bin/mail -s "** $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ Host Alert: $HOSTNAME$ is $HOSTSTATE$ **" 	$CONTACTEMAIL$
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This allows us to call a command later in Nagios by it’s defined command_name,such as check_local_load, instead of having to call the entire command including arguments.  Keeps the configs clean.</p>

<p>The next file, “generic.cfg”, contains templates for host configurations.  This file allows us to do two things: list common options that are defined for all of the hosts, and separate hosts into notification groups.  The definitions look like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>define host{
        name                            generic-admin
        notifications_enabled           1
        event_handler_enabled           1
        flap_detection_enabled          1
        process_perf_data               1
        retain_status_information       1
        retain_nonstatus_information    1
        register                        0
        check_command           check-host-alive
        max_check_attempts      3
        notification_interval   120
        notification_period     24x7
        notification_options    d,u,r
				contact_groups          admin,admin_pager
        action_url /nagios/pnp/index.php?host=$HOSTNAME$
        }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are two separate types of generic definitions, hosts and services, for the two types of monitoring that Nagios does.  The important section for most of my purposes above is the “contact_groups” line.  This allows me to group contacts with hosts, so it answers the question of “who gets notified if this server goes down?”.  The same thing applies to the service template below.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>define service{
        name                            generic-full	
        active_checks_enabled           1
        passive_checks_enabled          1
        parallelize_check               1
        obsess_over_service             1
        check_freshness                 0
        notifications_enabled           1
        event_handler_enabled           1
        flap_detection_enabled          1
        process_perf_data               1
        retain_status_information       1
        retain_nonstatus_information    1
        register                        0
        is_volatile                     0
        check_period                    24x7
        max_check_attempts              3
        normal_check_interval           5
        retry_check_interval            1
        notification_interval           120
        notification_period             24x7
        notification_options            w,c,r
	contact_groups                  admins,admin_pager,webmin
	process_perf_data 1
	action_url /nagios/pnp/index.php?host=$HOSTNAME$&amp;srv=$SERVICEDESC$
        }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The other two files, timeperiods.cfg and dependencies.cfg, I haven’t done a whole lot with yet.</p>

<p>The next directory parsed as defined in nagios.cfg is $nag/etc/users, which, surprisingly enough, is where all of the users are defined.  I keep two files in this directory, users.cfg and contactgroups,cfg.  The users.cfg file contains a list of every user, and since I have different needs for pagers and regular email alerts, each user is defined twice:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>define contact{
        contact_name                    Jon
        alias                           Jon Buys
        service_notification_period     24x7
        host_notification_period        24x7
        service_notification_options    w,u,c,r
        host_notification_options       d,u,r
        service_notification_commands   service-notify-by-email
        host_notification_commands      host-notify-by-email
        email                           jbuys@dollarwork.com
        }

define contact{
        contact_name                    Jon_pager
        alias                           Jon Buys
  	  service_notification_period     24x7
  	  host_notification_period        24x7
  	  service_notification_options    u,c,r
  	  host_notification_options       d,u,r
  	  service_notification_commands   notify-for-disk
  	  host_notification_commands      host-notify-by-email
  	  email 				5555555555@my.phone.company.net
  	  }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This lets me group the users more effectively in the second file, contactgroups.cfg:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>define contactgroup{
        contactgroup_name admins
  	  alias           sysadmins
  	  members Jon,Gary,nagios_alerts
  	  }

define contactgroup{
        contactgroup_name admin_pager
        alias           sysadmin pagers
        members Jon_pager,Gary_pager,OSS_Primary_Phone,nagios_alerts
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, check the definitions in the generic.cfg file above, and you’ll start to see the chain of config files coming together. The glue sticking it all together is the server definition files.  Each logical group of servers gets their own directory, defined in nagios.cfg.  For example, we have a  group of servers that provides a specific web service  (which I’ll call “mesh”), there are web servers, application servers, and database servers that I group together in one directory, named “mesh”.  Inside of this directory, each server has its own config file, named like $hostname.cfg.  There is also a mesh.cfg, which groups all of the servers together in a host group.  The $hostname.cfg files look like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> define host{
        use                     generic-host
  	  host_name              	m-app1 
  	  alias                   m-app1
  	  address                 10.10.10.1
  	  }

define service{
  	  use                             generic-full
  	  host_name                       m-app1
  	  service_description             PING
  	  check_command                   check_ping!100.0,20%!500.0,60%
  	  }

define service{
  	  use                             generic-full
  	  host_name                       m-app1
  	  service_description             DISKUSE
  	  check_command                   check_nrpe!check_df
  	  }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each server has a host definition at the top, and all of the services that are monitored on that server at the bottom.  The first section’s line “use	generic-host” calls the “generic-host” template from the generic.cfg file above.  Each subsequent “define service” section has a “use” line that also calls the templates defined in generic.cfg.  Putting each server in its own file makes it very easy to add and remove servers from Nagios.  To remove them, just remove (or, safer, rename) the $hostname.cfg file and delete the name from the $groupname.cfg file.  It’s also very easy to script the creation of new hosts given a list of host names and IP addresses.</p>

<p>The mesh.cfg file contains the hostgroup configuration for the group:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>define hostgroup{
   	 hostgroup_name  mesh
   	 alias           Mesh Production
   	 members         mdbs1,mdbs2,mdbs3,mdbs4,mdbs5,mdbs6,mdbs7,m-app1,m-app2,m-app3,m-store1,m-store2,m-nfs1,m-nfs2
   	 }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This file is not as important, but it makes the Nagios web interface a little more helpful.</p>

<p>You’ll also notice that the check_command line above contains “check_nrpe!check_df”.  This means that I use the nrpe (Nagios Remote Plugin Execution) add-on to actually monitor the services on the remote hosts.  Each server has nrpe installed, and has one configuration file (/usr/local/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg).  The nrpe.cfg file has a corresponding line that says</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>command[check_df]=/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_disk -e -L -w 6% -c 4%
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This translates the check_df command sent by the check_nrpe command into the longer command defined above.  This makes it easy to install and configure nrpe once, then zip up the  /usr/local/nagios directory and unzip it on all new servers.</p>

<p>Nagios is nearly limitless in its abilities, but but because of the complexity of its configuration it can be daunting to newcomers.  This setup is designed to make it just a little bit easier to understand, and easier to script.</p>
