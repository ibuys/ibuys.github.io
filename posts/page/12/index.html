          <p>In May of 1995 I <em>should</em> have graduated from high school in the rocky mountains of Montana. Then, in the following fall, say around August or September, I <em>should</em> have started my pursuit of a college degree. Finally, in May of 2000, I <em>should</em> have graduated from college with a bachelors degree in who knows what.</p>

          <p>As a general rule, I really don’t like to go outside of the box when it comes to Linux. And by that, I mean that I don’t like going outside of what is provided by what ever distribution you are using, be that SLES, Red Hat, or Ubuntu. A lot of people put a lot of work into making sure that the packages that are available for the distribution actually work in the distribution and do not interfere with any other apps. Linux will let you do what ever you want, but just because you <em>can</em> do something, doesn’t mean that you <em>should</em>.</p>

<p>Going outside the box can have disastrous results with Linux. Back in early 2000 and 2001 when I was installing SuSE and Mandrake on my old IBM box, I wound up in dependency hell more than once. If you’ve never been there, it goes something like this:</p>

<p>OK, I want to upgrade my music player to the latest version, so I’ll download the latest RPM. Wait, that failed, because it depends on a newer version of some library file that I don’t have, so I’ll go search the Internet and try to find that. OK, found it, downloaded the rpm, and it failed to install because it depends on a newer version of some other library file that I don’t have.  Looks like there’s no RPM for that library, so I’ll download the source code and compile it. OK, ./configure; make; make install; Nope, that failed because of a gigantic list of dependencies that are not available! At this point, you have to make a decision: Do you go ahead and find the dependencies, or do you give up and have a drink instead. If you choose to go ahead, you download the source to a dozen different packages and install them, then compile your library, then compile your other library, then go to install the rpm to find that it fails because one of the applications you upgraded along the way is, get this, too new to support your music player, and the install still fails.  Oh, and by the way, half of your other apps that used to work, don’t work anymore.</p>

      <p>
        
          <p>Remember the early days of networking… before TCP/IP became the standard protocol?  Well, neither do I, but I’ve read about it.  That’s years ago now, but back then, each computer manufacturer developed their own method of networking their machines together, and each method, or protocol, was incompatible with the other.  Apple had AppleTalk, Novell had IPX/SPX, Xerox had XNS, and on and on it went.  TCP/IP was born out of the desire to create a vendor independent network, which became known as ARPAnet, and later, the Internet.</p>

<p>This little history lesson is meant to illustrate the tremendous advantages there are to open standards.  Would the Internet exist if it belonged to a single corporation?  Not as it is today, no.  These same ideas can be applied to several other forms of data on the computer; images, documents, music, etc…  We now have the capability to keep almost all of our data in a format that is guaranteed to provide greater flexibility, so why isn’t Apple taking advantage of it?</p>

<p>For example, Mail, the venerable email client that comes with the Mac, provides suitable email functionality for most Mac users.  Now that I’ve got several years of email stored on my Mac, I’d like to be able to keep those files in a format that is not subject to any corporation’s whims.  I’d also like to be able to drop my mail folder on another platform and be able to open it up in a different client… interoperability.  Another example is iPhoto, one of my favorites.  Would it really be that difficult for Apple to design iPhoto so it stores its database in a reliable, documented format that is readable (and writable) outside the application?</p>

<p>This goes back to a central belief I have about  data, and applications.  While the application may belong to its author, the data it processes belongs to me, and it should be available to me in a well documented, open format.  Open formats make sharing files easier, as they are capable of being supported on more platforms</p>

<p>How about giving Quicktime the ability to natively export to Ogg-Theora?  Or allowing iTunes to use Ogg-Vorbis as its default media format? (DRM not considered here…)  Pages?  Keynote?  How about some Open Document Format support?  I really don’t think the move to open formats would be that big of a leap.  Apple already includes several open source applications inside its server offering, and has built its core data framework around XML and SQLite, so why not open the rest of it up?</p>

<p>The other note worth mentioning is the high profile “switch to linux” news that has been making the rounds lately.  With several long time Mac supporters moving to Linux citing problems with formats and a lack of openness from Apple, it seems to me that this is a problem that could be easily fixed.  I’m not calling on Apple to open source OS X, I’m not even implying that, although open sourcing a few of the bundled apps might be a good thing in the long term</p>

<p>The world is becoming more aware, and times they are a changin.  The world is knocking, dear Apple, its time to open up.</p>

          <p>Where I spend my days ($WORK), we have multiple monitoring systems for just about every service on every server that we have.  Many of these are <a href="http://www.nagios.org/">Nagios</a>, some are built in, and others are <a href="https://h10078.www1.hp.com/cda/hpms/display/main/hpms_content.jsp?zn=bto&amp;cp=1-11-15-25%5E849_4000_100__">SiteScope</a>.  All of the systems generate email alerts that either go to our pagers, our email, or both.  From time to time, management would ask a question like “How many pages do you get in a week on average”, which up till a couple of months ago, our answer was always “It just depends”.</p>

          <p>I love Linux, I really do. Compared to the older UNIX systems like AIX, HP-UX, and Solaris (who is trying really hard to catch up) Linux is head and shoulders above the rest. The main reason for this is that a lot of really smart people also love Linux, and try their best to make it the best server on the planet. For the most part, I’d agree that we are succeeding on that front. On the other hand, to date, I simply can’t run Linux on my desktop. If there are servers down, or an application fault somewhere, I need to be able to rely on my tools to be there for me. That’s why I run XP on my laptop.</p>

          <p>My personal browser of choice has almost always been <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">Omniweb</a>. Omniweb and I went through a tough time for a while when it (she?) was crashing frequently and generally having a tough time of it. The Omni Group has once again straightened things out, and she (yea, I’ve decided Omniweb is a she) is once again fast, sleek, and powerful. There is one small item about the browser that bothers me though, and that is the lack of a search function from the browsers contextual menu that pops up when you select a word and right click on it.</p>

          <p>My wife wanted me to read something that she was writing the other day, so I sat down at her laptop on our table and read through it. While I was there, I happened to glance at her email, an old hotmail account, and noticed that she has emails going all the way back to ‘01. A quick glance at my gmail tells me that there is no way I can tell how far back my email goes, but I’m pretty sure that I’ve lost everything prior to ‘05 or so. I’ve been accused of having email ADD in the past, and I’m fairly certain there is a bit of truth to it. It seems to hold true for a lot of the technology in my life, I’m just never satisfied with it, and wind up tweaking, fiddling, and otherwise screwing around with my tools until they are either just right or completely screwed up and I throw the entire thing in the trash and start over.</p>

<p>This certainly holds true for my email, I have been through @aol.com, @hotmail.com, @yahoo.com, @mac.com, @inbox.com, @live.com, and finally, @gmail.com. It also holds true for my web sites. I’ve started 10 or 15 web sites throughout the years, starting with a geocities site back in… what, ‘99 or so? If I’d have stayed on top of it, I’d have managed to compile a decent amount of writing in one place for 9 years. But, I have some form of technology ADD, and can not seem to be happy with any single system. When I discovered Linux, my curiosity really got the best of me. I must have downloaded and tested 100-125 distros. I installed so many that I started recording them on my old (now defunct) blog, jonstechblog.com, which evolved into the also now defunct, osvids.com. This went on until I “switched” to Mac, and I’ve been fairly happy with my operating system since. At least I know that there is nothing else out there that’s any better than what I have now.</p>

<p>I’ve learned a lot about what I want out of my technology over the years, and I’ve found that when I find a good system, even if its not perfect, its best to stick with it until there is a significant reason to change. My curiosity has unfortunately led to my loosing data. Somewhere along the line I lost a lot of email, and a lot of writing, and there is no way to get that back. So, now, I’ve come to a point where I’m content in the systems that I have in place. My email works great, my OS works great, and I have an excellent blogging platform on a reliable host. I’ve started over far, far too many times, and it’s time to settle down and shoot down some roots. Its time to stop worrying about the method of creation, and focus on the creative process itself.</p>

          <p>I recently gave Linux my second, and final, serious shot at running it full time as my primary operating system on my MacBook. This time, it lasted all of three days before I dug out my Leopard install disk and began the long migration back to OS X. To preempt any questions on the subject, no I didn’t <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/bootcamp.html">dual boot</a>, and no, I didn’t have a good <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html">time machine</a> backup. I was going to force myself to learn to do things the Linux way on my laptop.</p>

          <p>A friend of mine is having a heck of a time with his new MacBook. He’s a recent convert to Macs, and as a philosophy student he spends a <em>lot</em> of time in Word. When he first bought his shiny new MacBook, he was surprised to find out there was no word processor in it. I pointed out TextEdit, which he quickly dismissed as not nearly powerful enough for what he needed to do. So, back to the store he went to pick up a copy of iWork ‘08, and started working with Pages.</p>

          <p>To create the perfect datacenter, what would you recommend? For me, the perfect datacenter would be based on <em>agility</em>. We would be able to add new capacity when needed, and reallocate resources whenever needed, quickly and easily. We would be able to backup everything, securely and easily, off-site.  We would use, whenever possible, open source software so we would not be constricted by licensing schemes. Would we have a SAN? Yes, most likely something very simple to administrate, like a NetApp. We would boot from the SAN, have no moving parts in the servers themselves, so we would have very few hardware failures. Whenever possible we would keep to one style of hardware, ie: all blades, or all 1U rack mounts, etc…</p>

          <p>Today I was out in the data center and decided to boot into Linux to get some work done on my Dell laptop. I was busy populating our internal wiki with hardware and OS data from our servers (how many dimms, what size, kernel level, etc…), which is a lot of work, lots of copy and paste, formating, grepping, going back and forth between the terminal and firefox. Lots of moving around, but not a lot of cpu or memory intensive tasks, just basic office tasks. I’m using <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, with Gnome and the desktop effects turned on, and I got so frustrated that I booted back into Windows. I hate to say it, but I was able to get more done in Windows today than I could in Linux.</p>

          <p>Software licensing is one of the biggest expenses of high-end server systems.  The vendors charge you not only to use the software, but they charge you for how <em>efficiently</em> you want to use the software as well.  IBM, for example, charges a different license fee for <a href="http://www.cbronline.com/article_news.asp?guid=3331CC24-A0A7-4180-A7D9-032C72F9DD5F">AIX</a> determined by how many cpus are in the system.  So, to scale in response to load, weather its up or out, you have to pay for additional hardware, and then you have to pay for the ability to <em>use</em> that hardware.  We are not talking small numbers here either, we are talking in the upwards of six figures <sup><a href="#fn1-2008-02-17">1</a></sup>, in addition to the cost of the hardware.  In addition to that, if you are using proprietary applications on top of the OS, you are going to have to pay additional licensing fees for those as well.  <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/was/">WebSphere</a> in particular charges on a per cpu basis.</p>

          <p>A couple of months ago Linux Magazine published an <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/4641">article</a> written by Scott Granneman comparing Mac OS X Leopard and Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon.  I’ve been torn between these two systems, and their respective predecessors for years, so the article was of great interest to me.  As a matter of fact, I was wondering how I missed it to begin with.  The article is well written, but can be boiled down to this one paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Linux has come a long way when it comes to ease of use, and it’s definitely getting better all the time, but overall Leopard is still ahead of Ubuntu (and both are way ahead of Vista). Apple makes mistakes, but overall its system is more logical, simple, consistent, and unified than Ubuntu, which still has too many elements that are overly complex, inconsistent, and fractured.</p>

          <p>Seriously, does anyone really need to know <em>how</em> to loose weight these days?  No matter what super plan you choose, it always comes down to <strong>eat less an exercise more</strong>. There is no secret formula, and there is no magic pill that will help you achieve the body that you want.</p>

<p>Here’s another truth that no one wants to hear: your weight is your fault. You cannot blame genetics, how you were taught to eat, your job, your wife, your husband, your kids, your dog, the government, or any other outside influence other than yourself. It is true that some people are more prone to weight gain than others, but that does not mean that you can’t do anything about it.  Blaming anything except your own habits is a cop-out. To start the 100% guaranteed program, you have to face reality, and you have to take responsibility for your own actions.</p>

<p>So, here’s my super simple, 100% guaranteed, no way you can <em>not</em> lose weight, weight loss plan.</p>

<p>Step one, watch what you eat. That means no McDonalds, Burger King, Hardie’s, or Sonic. Eating fast food makes you fat. I like a <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/app_controller.nutrition.index1.html">double-quarter pounder</a> with fries as much as the next guy, but seriously, you never need that many calories in one setting. I’d say that’s like a once every six months meal, not once a week (or day). If you have to eat out, go to Subway and order a six-inch <a href="http://world.subway.com/Countries/NutritionFiles/AUS%209.2005.pdf">veggie delight</a> on whole wheat. Seriously, try it, they are really good!</p>

<p>Next, stop right now and go look in your refrigerator and your pantry. OK, how much pre-prepared food did you see? Boxed, one-pan, no cooking skills necessary stuff, you know what I mean. If you are eating ingredients that you cannot pronounce, there is a problem. For example, I cannot think of the last time a recipe called for <a href="http://chemindustry.com/chemicals/467010.html">L-Cystein Hydrochloride</a>. Use raw ingredients as much as possible. Even if the resulting recipe is high in fat and calories, at least you know what’s in it. That leads me to my next point.</p>

<p>Fill up half your plate with veggies. Make a salad that only contains vegetables. Lettuce, carrots, cabbage, broccoli, olives, onions, etc… Fill up a quarter of your plate with a slice of bread or something similar. This is your side dish. That doesn’t mean that it gets its own plate, its there to take up room on your plate, and therefor in your stomach. Now you should have only a quarter of your plate left to fill, that’s for the main course. Also, get a pint glass of ice cold water to go with your meal. Drink the water before drinking anything else.</p>

<p>Speaking of drinking, here’s another hard lesson to learn. Alcohol makes you fat. Alcohol add nothing of value to your diet. As in all things, moderation is OK, but drinking a six pack a night is a sure path to failure. Also, drinking a bottle of wine in one sitting is also very bad for your health.  Remember the glass of water at dinner time? Drink that first, and you won’t be as tempted to drink so much beer or wine or whatever you like with your meal.</p>

<p>So, that covers eating and drinking, now for the fun part: exercise! If the sun is shining, turn off the TV, shutdown the computer, and go outside. It’s actually very difficult <em>not</em> to exercise when you are outside, because there is always something to do. At the very least, take a walk. Do some gardening, shovel snow, make a snowman, go out and <strong>do something</strong>. You can pick up a sport. I’m learning how to swim laps in a pool. It’s not as easy as it sounds, but learning something new is enthralling. I get bored weight lifting and running on the treadmill, but you may really enjoy it.</p>

<p>There are literally thousands of sports, and if you keep looking, you are bound to find one that’s just challenging enough without being too overbearing. However, you must be brave, because here is the final hard lesson to learn. When you try something new, you are going to look like a fool. This is universal, and unavoidable. No matter what it is, no one is good at something the first time they try it. No matter what your chosen exercise is, until you get <em>good</em> at it, you are going to look silly. Be brave, this will pass. Here’s the great thing, the more you do it, the better you get at it, and the less ridiculous you will look doing it. Right now I rather resemble an obese housecat thrown into the pool while I’m learning how to swim. That’s OK, it will pass, the more I swim, the better I get at it.</p>

<p>Nothing worth doing is easy.</p>

          <p>On Monday, the 23rd, at 9:17 AM, we were blessed with our fourth child, Jacob. Jacob and his Mom are home now, after a few days stay in the hospital at the University of Iowa. Jacob is strong and healthy, waking every few hours to eat and burp and have his diaper changed.</p>
