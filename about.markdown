### Technology

All writing on this site is done using Markdown in [BBEdit][1] on a 2017 iMac 5k. The site is generated by [Jekyll][2], and hosted by [Github Pages][3]. This site uses no plugins, no javascript, and has no tracking capability. You can [view the source][4] to verify. 

### Design

This site uses my own theme, but the design is based heavily off of [Inessential][5], by Brent Simmons. I appreciated his bare-bones approach to web design and blogging, so I learned what I could from right-clicking and viewing source. Hopefully, he sees this as the sincerest form of flattery that it is. 

### Culture

I think a lot about questions that are hard to answer. What is being a full-time connected society doing to us? How can we use new technology for good, how can we make the world a better place?

### Personal

I love meeting new people, and especially love good conversation. If you are ever around the Midwest, drop me a line and Iâ€™ll show you the best coffee shop in town.

> So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

[1 Corinthians 13:13][8]
